In this article, we will explore what frunks are, the types of cargo they can hold, their possibilities and limitations, and some examples of EVs with frunks.

## What are frunks?

A frunk, a portmanteau of "front" and "trunk," refers to the cargo space available at the front of an EV. Frunks are possible because EVs do not have a conventional engine under the hood. Instead, they have batteries and other components usually placed low within the vehicle’s structure, leaving space at the front for storage. While frunks are not a new concept—some mid-engine or rear-engine vehicles like the Porsche 911 or Volkswagen Beetle also have frunks—they have become more common with the rise of EVs, offering a unique and convenient way to increase cargo capacity.

## What types of cargo can frunks hold?

The cargo that frunks can hold varies depending on their size, shape, and design, as well as the items the owner wants to store or transport. Frunks can accommodate various types of cargo, such as groceries, luggage, camping gear, or sports equipment. They can also be used for specific purposes, such as keeping items cool, dry, or secure.

For example, some frunks have insulation, drainage, or locking features suitable for storing food, beverages, or valuables. Frunks can also be customized or accessorized with dividers, nets, bags, or boxes to organize and protect the cargo.

Frunks offer many possibilities and advantages for EV owners, such as:

### Extra storage

Frunks provide additional storage space for EVs, especially those with limited trunk or cabin space. They allow EV owners to carry more or larger items that would not fit in the trunk or cabin, freeing up space for passengers or other cargo.

### Easy access

Frunks offer easy access to cargo, as they are located at the front of the vehicle and do not require opening the rear door or tailgate. They can be opened or closed remotely using a key fob, button, or smartphone app, making them convenient for loading or unloading items in tight parking spaces.

### Improved safety

Frunks enhance safety for both cargo and the vehicle. They are enclosed and protected by the vehicle's body and windows, preventing cargo from flying around or hitting passengers in case of a sudden stop or collision. Frunks also reduce the risk of theft, as they are less visible and more secure than the trunk or cabin.

## Examples of EVs with frunks

Many EVs on the market or in development feature frunks, but some stand out for their size, design, and features.
