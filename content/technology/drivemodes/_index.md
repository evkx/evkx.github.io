Drive modes can be selected by the driver using a button, a knob, or a touchscreen, depending on the vehicle model. Some EVs may also have an automatic or adaptive mode that adjusts the drive mode according to the driving conditions and the driver's behavior.

## What aspects of the car's dynamics do drive modes affect?

Drive modes affect various aspects of the car's dynamics, such as its speed, acceleration, braking, handling, and comfort. Here are some examples of how drive modes affect these aspects:

### Acceleration

Drive modes affect the vehicle's acceleration by changing the motor's power output and torque. Higher power output and torque result in faster acceleration, while lower power output and torque result in slower acceleration. For example, Sport mode improves the vehicle'svehicle's acceleration by increasing the power output and torque. In contrast, Eco mode reduces the vehicle's acceleration by decreasing the power output and torque.

### Regenerative Braking

Drive modes can affect the vehicle's braking by changing the level of regenerative braking. A higher level of regenerative braking results in stronger and faster deceleration, while the lower level results in softer and slower deceleration. For example, Eco mode enhances the vehicle's braking by increasing the level of regenerative braking. In contrast, Sport mode weakens the vehicle's braking by decreasing the level of regenerative braking.

Many models control regen with different regen modes and are unaffected by the drive mode.

### Steering

Drive modes affect the handling of the vehicle by changing the steering and suspension systems. Higher steering responsiveness result in better handling for dynamic driving.

### Suspension damping

For models with adaptive dampers the suspension damping(stiffness) 

### Suspension height

On Evs with air suspension the drive modes typically affect the height of the suspension and therby the ground clearance. For example will efficiency modes lower the car to reduce drag, while offroad mode will maximize the ground clearance.

On some models the suspension heigh will be adjusted based on speed.

In the EVKX EV database you can search for models with drive modes.

### Climate system

In some modes that power to climate system can be reduced. This is typical for eco modes.

## What are the most common drive modes?

The most common drive modes in EVs are Eco, Comfort, and Sport. These modes are designed to balance the trade-off between performance and efficiency, as well as to suit different driving styles and situations. Here is a brief overview of each mode:

### Eco

This mode prioritizes efficiency and range over performance and comfort. It reduces the power output and torque of the motor, making the acceleration smoother and slower. It also increases the level of regenerative braking, making the deceleration stronger and faster. It may also limit the use of auxiliary systems, such as air conditioning and heating, to save energy. Eco mode is suitable for city driving, traffic jams, or long trips, where speed and agility are not essential. Manufacturers name this mode different, some examples are Efficiency (Audi), 

### Comfort

This mode provides a balanced and comfortable driving experience. It delivers a moderate level of power and torque, making the acceleration responsive and agile. It also adjusts the level of regenerative braking to match the brake pedal pressure, making the deceleration smooth and natural. It may also optimize the use of auxiliary systems, such as air conditioning and heating, to maintain a pleasant cabin temperature. Comfort mode is suitable for everyday driving, where performance and efficiency are equally important.

### Sport

This mode maximizes performance and fun over efficiency and comfort. It increases the power output and torque of the motor, making the acceleration rapid and powerful. It also reduces the level of regenerative braking, making the deceleration softer and slower. It may also enhance the steering, suspension, and sound systems, to provide a more engaging and thrilling driving experience. Sport mode is suitable for highway driving, overtaking, or racing, where speed and agility are paramount.

## What are some examples of uncommon drive modes?

Some EVs may offer additional or alternative drive modes that cater to specific needs or preferences of the drivers. These modes may vary depending on the vehicle model and manufacturer, but here are some examples of uncommon drive modes:

### Snow

This mode improves the traction and stability of the vehicle on slippery or snowy roads. It reduces the power output and torque of the motor, making the acceleration gentle and steady. It also increases the level of regenerative braking, making the deceleration firm and controlled. It may also activate the anti-lock braking system (ABS) and the electronic stability control (ESC) to prevent skidding and sliding.

### Off-road

This mode enhances the performance and durability of the vehicle on rough or uneven terrain. It increases the power output and torque of the motor, making the acceleration strong and robust. It also adjusts the level of regenerative braking to suit the terrain, making the deceleration smooth and consistent. It may also raise the ride height, stiffen the suspension, and lock the differential to improve the ground clearance, handling, and traction.

### Custom

This mode allows the driver to personalize the settings of the vehicle according to their preferences and needs. It enables the driver to adjust the power output, torque, regenerative braking, steering, suspension, and sound systems to create their own drive mode. It may also allow the driver to save and recall their custom settings for future use.
