Interior storage includes compartments, pockets, bins, trays, or holders located in various parts of the car, such as the doors, center console, glove box, seat backs, etc. Interior storage can be visible or hidden, fixed or flexible, open or closed, depending on the car model and preferences.

EVs often have more interior storage than their gas-powered counterparts because they have fewer and smaller parts that take up space. For example, EVs do not have a large engine under the hood, a transmission tunnel on the floor, or an exhaust system at the rear. This allows for more space for interior storage in areas such as the front trunk (frunk) and under-seat compartments.

## Center Console Storage

The center console is a prime location for storage in many EVs. It often includes compartments for small items, cup holders, and sometimes even wireless charging pads. The design and capacity of center console storage can vary significantly between different EV models.

## Glove Box

A glove box is a compartment in the dashboard used to store small items such as gloves, documents, and maps. It can be locked or unlocked with a key or a button and may have an interior light to help users see the contents. Some EVs have glove boxes similar to those in gas cars, while others offer more spacious or innovative designs. For example, the Tesla Model S has a glove box that can be opened and closed with a touchscreen command, and the Ford Mustang Mach-E has a glove box that can fit a laptop or tablet.

## Door Storage

Door storage typically includes pockets or bins located in the door panels. These can be used to store items like water bottles, umbrellas, or maps. The size and design of door storage compartments can vary, with some EVs offering more innovative or spacious solutions compared to traditional gas-powered cars.
