Here are some of the main aspects of EV interior design and how they differ from conventional cars.

## Space and Layout

One of the biggest advantages of EVs is the increased space and flexibility for interior layout compared to conventional cars. This is because EVs do not have internal combustion engines, transmissions, fuel tanks, exhaust pipes, or other components that take up space and limit the placement of seats, consoles, storage compartments, and other features. EVs also have flat floors and a lower center of gravity, which allow for more headroom, legroom, and cargo space.

Some of the ways that EVs utilize this extra space and flexibility include:

- Moving the dashboard forward to create a spacious, lounge-like cabin with more visibility and comfort for passengers. You can read more about dashboard and cockpit layouts in the [Cockpit design & layout section](cockpitdesign).

- Offering various seating configurations, such as swivel seats, reclining seats, foldable seats, or removable seats, to suit different needs and preferences. Seating is a large topic that EVKX.net has created a separate guide on. [Read the seat guide](../seats/).

- Providing more storage options, such as under-seat drawers, door pockets, center consoles, or trunk compartments, to accommodate various items and accessories.

- Integrating features such as wireless charging pads, cup holders, ambient lighting, or air vents into the floor or door panels to save space and enhance convenience.

## Technology and Connectivity

Another major aspect of EV interior design is technology and connectivity. EVs are equipped with advanced technologies that enhance the driving experience, safety, entertainment, and convenience for passengers and drivers. These technologies include:

- Digital displays and touchscreens that provide information and control for various functions, such as the speedometer, navigation, climate control, entertainment system, or driver assistance systems. [Read more about screens](../userinterface/screens/) in EVs in our user interface article.

- Voice control and digital assistants that allow passengers and drivers to interact with the car and access various services using natural language commands. [Read about voice control](../userinterface/screens/) in our user interface article.

- Biometric sensors and cameras that monitor the health, mood, or behavior of passengers and drivers and adjust the settings or features accordingly.

- Cloud-based services and over-the-air updates that provide real-time data and updates for the car's software or hardware.

- Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) that project images or information onto the windshield or windows to create immersive experiences or assist with navigation or safety.

## Materials and Sustainability

A third important aspect of EV interior design is materials and sustainability. EVs are more environmentally friendly than conventional cars in terms of emissions and energy consumption, but they also have to consider the environmental impact of their materials and production processes. EV interior designers have to choose materials that are durable, lightweight, recyclable, renewable, or biodegradable.

Some of the materials that are used or being developed for EV interiors include:

- Vegan leather or synthetic leather that mimics the look and feel of real leather but is made from plant-based or recycled materials.

- Bamboo or cork, which are natural materials that are renewable, biodegradable, and have antibacterial properties.

- Alcantara or microfiber, which are synthetic materials that are soft, breathable, stain-resistant, and easy to clean.

- Carbon fiber or aluminum, which are lightweight materials that reduce the weight of the car and improve its performance and efficiency.
