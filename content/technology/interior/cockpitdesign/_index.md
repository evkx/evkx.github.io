In this section, we will explore the cockpit design of today's EVs.

## Dashboard Design and Layout

The design and layout of the dashboard are crucial for the driver experience. Here are the most common forms of dashboard design:

### Fully Integrated Screens

In this design, the manufacturer has fully integrated the screens and controls into the dashboard, providing an upscale feel.

### Multiple Non-Integrated Screens

Mounting the screens on top of the dashboard without integrating them is a common way to keep costs down. However, it often feels like an afterthought or an aftermarket addition.

### Minimalistic with a Single Non-Integrated Screen

This design features a low dashboard with a single screen mounted on it, offering minimal protection against viewing from outside. This design is well-known from Tesla Model 3 and Model Y.

## Center Console Design

Several types of center console designs are used in car cockpits. These include:

### Traditional Center Console

This is the most common design, featuring a box-shaped unit between the driver and front passenger seats. It typically includes storage compartments, cup holders, and various controls for the car's audio and climate systems.

### Integrated Center Console

This type of center console integrates seamlessly into the car's dashboard or instrument panel, often featuring touchscreens or other advanced features.

### Floating Center Console

A floating center console is not attached to the floor or dash at the front end, creating space between the driver and the front passenger. This design can be less ideal as items can move between the driver and passenger.

### Minimalistic Storage and Armrest Only

This design offers only a storage area and an armrest, without being connected to the dashboard. It provides open space between the driver and the front passenger, typical for vans but also found in some regular EVs.

### Split-Level Center Console

This design features a two-tiered console, with a lower section for storage and cup holders and an upper section that houses the car's audio and climate control systems.
