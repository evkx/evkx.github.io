## Charging Levels

There are three main levels of charging:

- **Level 1** - This is the slowest and simplest way of charging an EV i USA. It uses a standard 120-volt AC outlet that can be found in any home or building. Level 1 charging can add about 3 to 5 miles of range per hour of charging, which means it can take several hours or even days to fully charge an EV battery. Level 1 charging is suitable for overnight or long-term parking, or for EVs with small batteries and low range.
- **Level 2** - This is the most common and convenient way of charging an EV in Europe. It uses a 240-volt AC outlet that can be installed by an electrician in a home, garage, or workplace. Level 2 charging can add about 25 miles of range per hour of charging, which means it can fully charge an EV battery in a few hours. Level 2 charging is suitable for daily or weekly charging, or for EVs with medium to large batteries and moderate to high range.
- **Level 3** - This is the fastest way of charging an EV on the road. It uses high-power DC current that can deliver up to 1000 volts and 600 amps depending on the charger. Level 3 charging can add up to 200 miles of range in just 20 to 30 minutes of charging, which means it can quickly replenish an EV battery for long-distance driving.
