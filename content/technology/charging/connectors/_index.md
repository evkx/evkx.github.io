## Connector Types

Charging ports can be classified by their connector type, which refers to the physical shape and size of the plug that connects the EV to the charging station. Different types of charging connectors vary by region, standard, and compatibility.

### J1772

J1772 is the standard Level 1 and Level 2 charging connector for all American EVs except Teslas. Created by the [Society of Automotive Engineers](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j1772_201710/) (SAE), it works with any Level 1 or Level 2 charger in the US. It has a round shape with five pins and a latch, delivering up to 19.2 kW of power.

### Type 2

Type 2 is the standard Level 2 charging connector for European EVs. Created by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), it works with any Level 1 or Level 2 charger in Europe. It has a round shape with seven pins and a latch, delivering up to 43 kW of power.

### CCS

The Combined Charging System (CCS) is the standard Level 3 charging connector for all EVs in Europe and most brands in America. Created by a [CharIN consortium](https://www.charin.global/) of automakers and standards organizations, it comes in two versions:

#### CCS Combo 1

Used in North America, it has a round shape with two additional DC pins below the J1772 connector. It can deliver up to 350 kW of power with a maximum of 920 Volts.

#### CCS Combo 2

Used in Europe, it has a round shape with two additional DC pins below the Type 2 connector. It can deliver up to 350 kW of power with a maximum of 920 Volts.

### NACS/J3400 (Tesla)

The [North American Charging Standard](https://www.tesla.com/blog/opening-north-american-charging-standard) (NACS), also known as the Tesla Connector, was opened for others by Tesla in 2022. It is the proprietary Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 charging connector for all Tesla EVs sold in North America. It has a rectangular shape with two pins and a button.

The [standard](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/HXVNIC_North_American_Charging_Standard_Technical_Specification_TS-0023666_HFTPKZ.pdf) allows it to deliver up to 250 kW of power with a maximum of 1000 Volts. Ford [announced](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2023/05/25/ford-ev-customers-to-gain-access-to-12-000-tesla-superchargers--.html) on May 25, 2023, that they will add a NACS port to their models from 2024 in North America. GM [followed suit on June 8, 2023](https://news.gm.com/newsroom.detail.html/Pages/news/us/en/2023/jun/0608-gm.html).

Since then, all major manufacturers have announced they will switch to NACS.

NACS is smaller and lighter than CCS Combo 1, making it easier to handle and plug in.

On December 18, 2023, it became the [J3400 standard](https://www.sae.org/standards/content/j3400_202312/).

### CHAdeMO

CHAdeMO is the standard Level 3 charging connector for most Japanese EVs, such as Nissan, Mitsubishi, and Toyota. Created by a [consortium of Japanese companies and organizations](https://www.chademo.com/), it has a round shape with two large DC pins and two small communication pins. It can deliver up to 62.5 kW of power.

## Charge Port Locations

EVs have different locations for their charge ports. Here are the most common:

### Rear Corner

This is a very common location, as all Tesla models have this configuration.

### Front Side

### Front Corner

The front corner is used by some and can be beneficial if you are towing a trailer.
