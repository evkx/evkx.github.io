## Cylindrical Housing

A cylindrical cell consists of sheet-like anodes, separators, and cathodes that are sandwiched, rolled up, and packed into a cylinder-shaped can. This form factor has been used by battery manufacturers for years, with sizes like AAA and AA commonly used in electronics.

### Advantages

1. **Mechanical Stability**: The round shape distributes internal pressure from side reactions almost evenly over the cell circumference, allowing the cell to tolerate higher internal pressure without deformation.
2. **High Production Throughput**: The cylindrical form factor allows for a high throughput of cells from production lines.

Tesla is one of the few EV manufacturers that use cylindrical cells.

## Prismatic Housing

Li-ion cells with prismatic housing consist of large sheets of anodes, cathodes, and separators sandwiched, rolled up, and pressed to fit into a hard-plastic or metallic housing in cubic form. The electrodes can also be assembled by layer stacking rather than jelly rolling.

### Advantages

- **Space Optimization**: The box-like shape optimizes the available space when combining prismatic cells into packs.

### Disadvantages

- **Stress on Components**: Parts of a prismatic cell's electrode and separator sheets close to the container corners can experience more stress, potentially damaging the electrode coating and leading to non-uniform electrolyte distribution.

## Pouch Housing

Pouch cells do not have a rigid enclosure like prismatic and cylindrical cells and use a sealed flexible foil as the cell container.

### Advantages

- **High Packaging Efficiency**: Achieves a 90 to 95 percent packaging efficiency, the highest among battery packs.
- **Flexible Size**: The flexible foil allows for various sizes and shapes.
- **Weight Reduction**: Eliminating the metal enclosure reduces weight.

### Disadvantages

- **Swelling**: Designers must allocate enough space for cell swelling, which can be as much as 8% to 10% after 500 cycles.

## Blade

Blade batteries are a type of lithium-ion battery that use a unique "blade" design for their cells. Unlike traditional cylindrical or prismatic cells, blade batteries are thin and flat, resembling the shape of a blade or wafer.

### Advantages

- **Compact and Efficient**: The blade design allows for a more compact and efficient battery pack.
- **Better Heat Dissipation**: The flat shape provides more surface area for cooling.
- **Safety**: Use of a ceramic separator between the anode and cathode layers provides better protection against internal short circuits and thermal runaway.

Blade batteries are primarily produced by the Chinese battery manufacturer BYD.
