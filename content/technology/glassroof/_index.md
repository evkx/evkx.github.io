A glass panel roof allows natural light and ventilation to enter the car, enhancing the aesthetic appeal and spaciousness of the interior.

## Types

A glass panel roof can be either fixed or movable. A fixed glass panel roof is permanently attached to the car frame and cannot be opened or closed. A movable glass panel roof can be opened or closed using a button, switch, or hand crank. A movable glass panel roof may be considered an extension of the power window concept.

### Sunroof

The smallest category of glass roof is a sunroof. This is a glass panel placed above the first row. This type of glass roof was available in the 80s and 90s.

### Panoramic Roof with Front Opening

This common design features two parts mounted together, where the first part is movable and can be opened, while the rear part is fixed.

Another variant is to have two separate glass panels.

### Panoramic Windshield and Glass Panel

Some models have a panoramic windshield that extends far up onto the roof. Combined with glass panels in the rear, it creates a roof with large panels.

## Blending

The glass typically protects against sun heat by reflecting most UV rays and allowing some heat to radiate out through the glass. However, some manufacturers add additional blending to reduce heat or increase privacy.

### Curtains

Curtains for glass roofs, also known as sunshades or sunroofs, are designed to block sunlight and heat from entering the vehicle through the glass roof.

### Electrochromic Glass

Electrochromic glass roofs can change their level of tint based on the amount of current running through them. This allows the driver to control the intensity of light from transparent to opaque with the push of a button. Some car manufacturers, such as Rivian, BMW, and Porsche, offer this option for their models.

## Weight & Noise

A glass panel roof is a luxury feature that adds value and comfort to the car. However, it also increases the weight and complexity of the car and may reduce its fuel efficiency and safety. A glass panel roof may also be more prone to leaks, cracks, or breakage due to weather conditions, road debris, or accidents.
