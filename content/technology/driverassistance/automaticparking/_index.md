Automatic Parking Assist (APA) uses a combination of sensors, cameras, and software to detect and maneuver the car into a parking spot.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Initiation**: The driver activates the automatic parking feature, either via a button or through a smartphone app.
2. **Scanning**: The vehicle's sensors and cameras scan the area around the car, using algorithms to identify available parking spots.
3. **Positioning**: The car moves forward slowly until it is correctly positioned for the parking maneuver.
4. **Maneuvering**: The car uses its sensors and cameras to guide itself into the parking spot, adjusting steering and acceleration as needed.
5. **Completion**: Once the car is in the parking spot, it stops and engages the parking brake.
6. **Exit**: The driver can then exit the car and lock it remotely, knowing that it is securely parked.

There are different types of automatic parking systems available, varying in the level of autonomy they provide. Some systems require the driver to control the acceleration and braking while the vehicle parks itself, while others are fully autonomous and require no input from the driver at all.

While automatic parking is a convenient feature, drivers should always remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings, especially in busy or crowded parking lots.
