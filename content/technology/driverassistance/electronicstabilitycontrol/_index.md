Electronic Stability Control (ESC), also known as Electronic Stability Program (ESP) or Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), is a standard safety feature in most modern vehicles. It enhances vehicle stability by detecting and reducing loss of traction.

## How ESC Works

ESC uses sensors and algorithms to monitor key parameters such as vehicle speed, steering angle, and wheel speed. If the system detects a loss of traction or stability, it intervenes to help the driver maintain control.

### Key Functions

1. **Continuous Monitoring:** The ESC system continuously tracks the vehicle's speed, steering angle, and other sensor data to determine the intended path.
2. **Deviation Detection:** If the vehicle deviates from its intended path due to oversteer or understeer, the ESC system activates.
3. **Brake Application:** The system applies brakes to individual wheels to help stabilize the vehicle and bring it back on course.
4. **Engine Power Reduction:** ESC may also reduce engine power to prevent skidding or spinning out of control.
5. **Gradual Release:** Once the vehicle is back on its intended path, the system gradually releases the brakes, allowing the driver to resume normal control.

## Benefits of ESC

- **Improved Stability:** Helps maintain vehicle stability during sudden maneuvers.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Reduces the risk of skidding and loss of control.
- **Automatic Intervention:** Provides automatic assistance without requiring driver input.

The specific implementation of ESC can vary between different vehicles and manufacturers, but the primary goal remains the same: to enhance vehicle stability and safety in challenging driving conditions.
