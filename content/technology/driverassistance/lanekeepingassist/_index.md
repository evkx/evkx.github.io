Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) designed to help drivers maintain their lane position. Unlike Lane Departure Warning (LDW), which only alerts the driver when they are about to leave their lane, LKA actively intervenes by applying steering inputs to keep the vehicle centered within the lane.

## How LKA Works

LKA uses sensors and cameras similar to those used in LDW to monitor the vehicle's position on the road and the distance between the vehicle and the lane markings. When the system detects that the vehicle is drifting out of its lane, it applies a gentle steering correction to guide the vehicle back to the center of the lane.

### Key Features

- **Active Steering:** Provides gentle steering inputs to keep the vehicle centered in its lane.
- **Speed Threshold:** Typically activates at speeds above 40 mph.
- **Driver Alerts:** Some systems include haptic warnings, such as vibrations in the steering wheel or seat, to alert the driver when the system is actively intervening.
- **Manual Control:** Can be activated and deactivated by the driver.

## Safety Considerations

While LKA adds an extra layer of safety and convenience, it is not a substitute for attentive and safe driving practices. Drivers should always remain focused and alert while behind the wheel. LKA is particularly useful in situations where the driver may be fatigued or distracted.

## Regulatory Compliance

The European Union (EU) has specific regulations and requirements for LKA systems installed in vehicles. According to EU regulation 2018/858, LKA is considered an advanced driver assistance system and must comply with several requirements to ensure its safety and effectiveness. One key regulation is that it should not be possible to permanently turn off LKA.
