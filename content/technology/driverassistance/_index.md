- [Anti-lock Braking System](antilockbrakingsystem/) (ABS)
- [Automated Lane Change](automatedlanechange/) (ALC)
- [Autonomous Emergency Braking](automaticemergencybraking/) (AEB)
- [Automatic Emergency Steering](automaticemergencysteering/) (AES)
- [Automatic Parking](automaticparking/)
- [Blind-Spot Monitoring](blindspotmonitoring/) (BSM)
- [Collision Avoidance Systems](collisionavoidancesystems/) (CAS)
- [Driver Drowsiness Detection](driverdrowsinessdetection/) (DDD)
- [Driver Monitoring System](drivermonitoringsystem/) (DMS)
- [Efficiency Assist](efficencyassist/)
- [Electronic Stability Control](electronicstabilitycontrol/) (ESC)
- [Exit Warning](exitwarning/) (EW)
- [Forward Collision Warning](forwardcollisionwarning/) (FCW)
- [Front Cross Traffic Assist](frontcrosstrafficassist/) (FCTA)

### Levels of Autonomous Driving

The level of autonomous driving, also known as the autonomy level, refers to the degree of automation and control a vehicle has over its operation.

The Society of Automotive Engineers ([SAE](https://www.sae.org/)) defines six levels of autonomy, describing increasing levels of automation and decreasing need for human input:

**Level 0** - No Automation: The driver is responsible for all aspects of driving, including steering, braking, and accelerating.

**Level 1** - Driver Assistance: The vehicle has some automation, such as adaptive cruise control or lane departure warning, but the driver is still responsible for most aspects of driving.

**Level 2** - Partial Automation: The vehicle can control both steering and acceleration/deceleration under certain conditions, but the driver must remain attentive and ready to take control at any time.

**Level 3** - Conditional Automation: The vehicle can handle most driving tasks under certain conditions, but the driver must still be prepared to take control when necessary.

**Level 4** - High Automation: The vehicle can operate autonomously in certain driving conditions and scenarios, such as on highways or designated areas, but may still require human intervention.

**Level 5** - Full Automation: The vehicle is fully autonomous and can operate in all driving conditions and scenarios without any human input or intervention.

Most vehicles on the market today fall into levels 1-2 of autonomy, while levels 3-5 are still in development and testing phases. Even vehicles with higher levels of autonomy may still require some level of human oversight and intervention in certain situations.

Currently, only the [Mercedes EQS](../../models/mercedes/eqs/) is approved for Level 3 autonomy in some markets.
