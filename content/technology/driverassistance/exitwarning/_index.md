Exit Warning is particularly useful when the car is parked in busy areas or on the side of a busy road.

## How Exit Warning Works

The Exit Warning system uses sensors, cameras, or radar to detect the presence of other vehicles, bicycles, or pedestrians near the car. When a potential hazard is detected, the system provides a warning to the driver or passengers through audible or visual alerts.

### Types of Alerts

- **Audible Alerts:** Chimes or beeps to catch the attention of the occupants.
- **Visual Alerts:** Messages or icons displayed on the car's screen.
- **Tactile Alerts:** Vibrations in the seat or steering wheel.

In some cases, the system may also activate the hazard lights to warn other drivers of the potential danger.

## Sensor Types

The Exit Warning system can vary depending on the car model and the type of sensors used:

- **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Located in the door panels, these sensors detect the presence of nearby vehicles or objects.
- **Cameras:** Mounted on the rear or sides of the car, these cameras detect approaching vehicles or pedestrians.
- **Radar Sensors:** Also mounted on the rear or sides, these sensors provide a broader detection range.

## Benefits of Exit Warning

Exit Warning is a valuable safety feature that helps prevent accidents and enhances overall safety for drivers and passengers. By providing a warning before the door is opened, it can help avoid collisions with other vehicles or cyclists, especially in urban areas with heavy traffic and limited visibility.
