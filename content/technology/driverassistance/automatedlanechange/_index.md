description: Automated Lane Change (ALC) is an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) that allows a vehicle to change lanes autonomously, without requiring the driver to steer or take manual control.

Automated Lane Change (ALC) systems are typically found in higher-end vehicles. They use a combination of sensors and cameras to detect other vehicles on the road and determine when it is safe to initiate a lane change.

## How It Works

1. **Driver Signals Intent:** The driver activates the turn signal to indicate the intention to change lanes.
2. **Environment Scanning:** The ALC system uses sensors and cameras to scan the surrounding traffic and identify any obstacles or vehicles in the way.
3. **Path Calculation:** The system calculates the optimal path for the lane change, considering the speed and position of other vehicles.
4. **Lane Change Initiation:** If the path is clear, the ALC system initiates the lane change by applying steering input to the vehicle.
5. **Continuous Monitoring:** The system continues to monitor the surrounding traffic and adjusts the vehicle's speed and trajectory as necessary to complete the lane change safely.
6. **Completion:** Once the vehicle is safely in the new lane, the ALC system disengages, allowing the driver to resume full control.

## Important Considerations

- **Driver Attention:** ALC systems are not capable of handling all driving scenarios. The driver must remain attentive and ready to take control of the vehicle at any time.
- **Limitations:** The system may require the driver to take control in certain situations, such as poor road conditions or unexpected obstacles.
- **Not a Replacement:** ALC systems are designed to assist the driver, not replace them. The driver is still responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle.
