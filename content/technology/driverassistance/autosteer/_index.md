Lane Centering Assist (LCA) / Autosteer is typically used in combination with other features, such as adaptive cruise control, to provide a more automated driving experience.

## How It Works

Autosteer uses a combination of cameras, sensors, and other technologies to detect the vehicle's position within the lane and the position of other vehicles on the road. The system then adjusts the steering to keep the vehicle centered within the lane, maintaining a safe following distance from vehicles ahead.

## Activation and Usage

To use Autosteer, the driver activates the system using a button or switch on the steering wheel or dashboard. The system may require the driver to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times and periodically provide alerts or prompts to ensure the driver remains alert and engaged.

## Driver Attention and Engagement

Many Autosteer systems have time limits or other requirements for driver attention and engagement. For example, Tesla's Autopilot system requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and be prepared to take over control at any time. The system will periodically send alerts to remind the driver to stay engaged. If the driver does not respond, Autosteer may be disabled, and the vehicle will slow down and eventually stop.

Other manufacturers have similar requirements and may include time limits or other restrictions on how long the autonomous driving features can be used continuously. It's crucial for drivers to read and understand the limitations and requirements of their specific vehicle's system before using it on the road.

## Levels of Autonomous Driving

Autosteer systems are typically classified as Level 2 autonomous driving. Currently, Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot on the EQS is the only approved Level 3 system.
