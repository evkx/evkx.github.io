CAS typically use a combination of sensors, such as radar, cameras, and lidar, to monitor the environment around the vehicle and detect potential hazards.

CAS systems can include a range of different features, such as [Forward Collision Warning](../forwardcollisionwarning) (FCW), [Automatic Emergency Braking](../automaticemergencybraking) (AEB), [Blind Spot Monitoring](../blindspotmonitoring) (BSM), Lane Departure Warning (LDW), and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), among others. Each of these systems is designed to help prevent or mitigate collisions in different ways.

For example, FCW uses sensors to detect potential collisions with vehicles or objects ahead and provides a warning to the driver. AEB can apply the brakes automatically to avoid or reduce the severity of a collision. BSM can detect vehicles or objects in the blind spot and provide a warning to the driver. LDW can alert the driver if the vehicle is drifting out of its lane. ACC can maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front by automatically adjusting the speed of the vehicle.

Overall, the goal of CAS is to help drivers avoid or reduce the severity of collisions by providing advanced warnings and/or automatically taking action to prevent or mitigate the impact. However, it's important to note that CAS systems are not foolproof, and drivers should always remain attentive and be prepared to take evasive action if necessary.

Some advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) can steer the car away from danger to help avoid a collision. These systems are typically referred to as "collision avoidance" or "collision avoidance with steering" systems.

One example of such a system is the Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system, which uses cameras and sensors to detect when the vehicle is drifting out of its lane and can automatically steer the vehicle back into its lane to avoid a collision. Another example is the [Automatic Emergency Steering](../automaticemergencysteering/) (AES) system, which uses sensors to detect potential collisions with pedestrians or other objects and can automatically steer the vehicle to avoid a collision.

It's important to note that while these systems can help prevent or mitigate collisions, they are not foolproof and should not be relied upon as a substitute for safe and attentive driving practices. Drivers should always remain alert and be prepared to take evasive action if necessary. Additionally, these systems may not be available on all vehicles or may require certain conditions to be met in order to function properly.
