## How Efficiency Assist Works

Efficiency Assist uses data from the vehicle's sensors and onboard computer to analyze the driver's behavior and offer suggestions for improvement. Key features include:

- **Regenerative Braking Optimization:** Monitors the driver's braking behavior and provides suggestions for optimizing regenerative braking, which converts the vehicle's kinetic energy into electrical energy to recharge the battery.
- **Speed Optimization:** Analyzes the driver's speed and provides suggestions for driving at a more efficient speed to conserve battery life.
- **Route Optimization:** Offers suggestions for more efficient routes based on traffic conditions, terrain, and other factors.
- **Predictive Driving:** Uses data from the vehicle's sensors and GPS to anticipate changes in traffic and road conditions, providing suggestions for more efficient driving techniques.
