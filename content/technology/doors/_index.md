Doors also integrate side windows for visibility and ventilation, and may have other features such as mirrors, handles, locks, speakers, and storage compartments. Depending on the design and style of the car, doors may vary in size, shape, location, and mechanism.

## Door Locations & Types

There are different types of doors in cars, depending on how they are attached and opened. Some of the common types are:

### First Row Doors

These are the doors located at the front of the car, usually on both sides of the driver's seat. They are typically hinged on their front edge and open outward. They are also called driver's door and passenger's door.

## Rear Openings

There are several types of rear openings:

### Trunk Lid

A trunk lid is standard on many sedans. The lid is typically hinged below the rear window. A sedan with a trunk lid has a more separated trunk area than the rest of the cabin. A trunk lid rear door limits the size of objects in the trunk compared to sedans with a hatchback-style liftgate.

### Hatchback Style Liftgate

A hatchback style liftgate on a car is a type of door that opens upwards at the rear of the car, allowing access to the cargo area. This style of car comes equipped with a ‘fifth’ door in the form of a liftgate that provides easy access to the cargo area.

## Features of Doors in Cars

Doors in cars may have various features that enhance their functionality, convenience, safety, or appearance. Some of the common features are:

### Soft Close

This feature automatically pulls the door shut when it is partially closed, preventing slamming or bouncing. It reduces noise and wear and tear on the door mechanism.

### Powered Opening

This feature allows the door to be opened or closed by pressing a button or using a remote control, without manual effort. It is usually found on hatchbacks, lids, or sliding doors. Some luxury models like the BMW i7 and Mercedes EQS have it available on the first and second row doors.

### Kick Sensor

This feature allows the door to be opened or closed by waving a foot under the bumper or sill of the car, without touching anything. It is useful when carrying items or having dirty hands. Available on rear trunk or liftgate.

### Flush Door Handle

A flush door handle on EVs is a type of door handle that is recessed into the door and does not protrude outwards. Electric cars have flush door handles to reduce aerodynamic drag and to give the car a sleeker look. Some styles aim to impress buyers with handles that pop out on approach. They also provide extra security but come with downsides such as reliability, safety concerns, and operation in icy conditions.
