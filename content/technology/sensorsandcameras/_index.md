### Common Sensor Technologies in Cars

- **Radar:** Radar sensors use radio waves to detect the distance, speed, and direction of objects around the vehicle. They are commonly used in systems such as adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, and rear cross-traffic alert. Learn more about [radar sensors](radar).

- **Ultrasonic:** Ultrasonic sensors use sound waves to measure the distance between the vehicle and nearby objects. They are typically used in parking sensors and other systems requiring close-range detection. Discover more about [ultrasonic sensors](ultrasonic).

- **LiDAR:** LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors use laser beams to create a 3D map of the vehicle's surroundings, enabling highly accurate object detection and ranging. LiDAR is commonly used in autonomous driving systems and is becoming more prevalent in ADAS features. Explore [LiDAR sensors](lidar).

- **Cameras:** Cameras are integral to various ADAS systems, such as lane departure warning, traffic sign recognition, and pedestrian detection. They use image processing algorithms to analyze video feeds and detect objects, lane markings, and other road features. Read about [cameras in EVs](cameras).

- **Infrared:** Infrared sensors detect objects in the vehicle's path using heat signatures. They are commonly used in night vision systems, helping drivers see more clearly in low-light conditions. Learn all about [infrared sensors](infrared).

### Choosing the Right Sensor Technology

The choice of sensor technology depends on the specific requirements of each system and the trade-offs between factors such as cost, performance, and reliability. Many modern cars use a combination of different sensor types to provide a comprehensive suite of ADAS features and safety systems.
