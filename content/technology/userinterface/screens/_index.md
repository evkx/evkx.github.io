Screens in modern EVs display various information, including battery levels, charging status, navigation, media, and more. The size and layout of these screens can vary from one model to another, but they all aim to make the driver's experience more intuitive and user-friendly.

## Screen Types

Screens in EVs can be categorized into different types and features:

### Digital Instruments

Digital instrument clusters, or driver information displays, replace traditional analog gauges. These screens typically provide information such as speed, battery level, odometer, trip information, and navigation directions. Some models allow drivers to customize the display to show preferred information.

The infotainment system is a central screen that combines various multimedia functions.
