Manufacturers design physical buttons to provide drivers and passengers with convenient access to various vehicle features and settings.

## Types of Buttons

### Instrument Panel Buttons

These buttons are typically located on the instrument panel in front of the driver, which contains gauges, displays, and controls. They may control functions such as lights, wipers, climate control, and other vehicle settings.

### Steering Wheel Buttons

Integrated into the steering wheel, these buttons provide convenient access to various functions such as audio controls, phone controls, cruise control, voice commands, and vehicle information displays.

## Functionality

The functionality of buttons in cars can vary significantly depending on the vehicle's make, model, and trim level. They can control a wide range of functions, including but not limited to:

- Audio and infotainment systems
- Climate control
- Interior and exterior lighting
- Wipers and washers
- Seat adjustments
- Window and door lock controls
- Parking sensors
- Camera views
- Traction control

Many modern cars also feature buttons linked to advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) such as lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems, allowing the driver to activate or deactivate these features as needed.

## Design and Placement

Automakers carefully consider the design and placement of buttons to ensure easy accessibility and intuitive operation while driving. Buttons are typically labeled or iconized for easy identification and may have tactile feedback, such as clicks or resistance, to provide a sense of confirmation when pressed. They are often made of durable materials such as plastic or metal and may have backlighting or illumination for visibility at night or in low-light conditions.

## Physical Buttons vs. Screens

Twenty years ago, every function in a car had a physical button, but more and more functions are being moved to touch screens. Tesla is one of the most extreme manufacturers, with only a few physical buttons.

Physical buttons provide a convenient way to control various functions without navigating through menus or settings on screens, allowing for quick and easy operation. Well-designed buttons can contribute to safer driving practices by allowing drivers to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel while operating different vehicle functions. Tests also show that drivers can [perform tasks faster](https://www.vibilagare.se/english/physical-buttons-outperform-touchscreens-new-cars-test-finds) with physical buttons than with screens.
