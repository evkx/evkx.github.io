Mirrors are an integral component of a car's user interface, serving as critical visual aids that allow drivers to observe their surroundings and make informed decisions while driving.

In a typical car, there are three main types of mirrors:

## Rearview Mirror

The rearview mirror is typically located in the center of the windshield or attached to its upper edge. It allows the driver to monitor traffic and conditions behind the vehicle without turning their head.

### Day/Night Mirror

Some rearview mirrors have a day/night switch that allows the driver to adjust the mirror's brightness, reducing glare from headlights of vehicles behind during night driving.

### Rearview Camera Mirror

Some vehicles come equipped with a rearview camera mirror, which uses a rear-facing camera to capture the view behind the vehicle and displays it on a screen embedded in the rearview mirror. This provides a wider and unobstructed view, especially helpful when rear window visibility is compromised by passengers or cargo.

## Side Mirrors

Side mirrors, also known as wing mirrors or door mirrors, are mounted on the exterior of the car's doors on both the driver and passenger sides. They provide a view of the traffic and conditions alongside the vehicle, allowing the driver to change lanes, merge, and navigate safely.

### Heated Mirrors

Some vehicles have heated side mirrors, which help melt frost, ice, or condensation on the mirror surface for improved visibility in cold weather conditions.

### Power-Adjustable Mirrors

Many modern vehicles have power-adjustable side mirrors, which can be controlled electronically from inside the vehicle to adjust the mirror position for the driver's optimal view.

### Side-View Camera Mirror

Some vehicles also have side-view camera mirrors, which use cameras mounted on the sides of the vehicle to capture the view along the sides and display it on screens embedded in the side mirrors or the interior of the vehicle.

These cameras help the driver monitor blind spots and provide a wider field of view for parking or maneuvering. Additionally, they reduce wind resistance, thereby increasing range and reducing wind noise.

## Interior or Vanity Mirrors

Interior or vanity mirrors are typically located on the sun visors or overhead console, allowing the driver and passengers to check their appearance or view the interior of the vehicle.
