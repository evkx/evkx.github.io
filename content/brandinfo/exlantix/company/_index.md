## Exlantix – Chery’s Premium Global EV Brand

Exlantix is the premium electric vehicle brand launched by Chery Automobile under its high-end Exeed division. In China, the models are marketed under the Sterra name, while Exlantix is used for international markets. The brand represents Chery’s ambition to compete in the global premium EV segment and was officially unveiled at the Auto Shanghai 2023 event on April 18, 2023.

Exlantix focuses on advanced technology, luxurious design, and global adaptability. Built on Chery’s dedicated E0X platform, the brand targets premium buyers with cutting-edge innovations such as 800-volt architecture, ultra-fast charging, intelligent driver assistance systems, and flexible configurations supporting both battery-electric (BEV) and extended-range (EREV) powertrains.

The brand debuted internationally in 2024, starting with the Exlantix ET SUV and Exlantix ES sedan, with plans to expand rapidly into Europe, the Middle East, South America, and other key markets. By 2025, Exlantix aims to establish a presence in 20+ countries, positioning itself as a strong alternative to established premium EV manufacturers.
