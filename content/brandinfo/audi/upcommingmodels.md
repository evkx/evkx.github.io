### Audi A6 e-tron

The upcoming Audi A6 e-tron is an exciting addition to Audi’s electric vehicle lineup, expected to debut in 2024 and go on sale in early 20251. Here’s what we know so far:

Driving Range: Audi is targeting a driving range of more than 400 miles per charge1.
Powertrain: It will be powered by two electric motors, one for each axle, providing all-wheel drive1.
Fast Charging: The A6 e-tron will feature DC fast-charging capability, allowing the battery to charge from five percent to 80 percent in just 25 minutes1.
Design: Unlike the gasoline-powered A6 sedan, the A6 e-tron will have a hatchback design in its sloped rear roofline, which should offer a large cargo area similar to the current A71.
Interior: While the interior details haven’t been fully revealed, it’s expected to include a full roster of infotainment features, luxury materials, and sufficient room for four adults1.
Pricing: The price is expected to start around $80,000 and could go up to $100,000 depending on the trim and options1.
The A6 e-tron is set to compete with other luxury electric vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz EQE sedan and high-end versions of the Tesla Model S hatchback2. It’s part of Audi’s broader strategy to expand its e-tron electric vehicle series and will likely feature cutting-edge technology and design elements that align with Audi’s reputation for luxury and performance1.
