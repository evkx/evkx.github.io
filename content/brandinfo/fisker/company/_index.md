## Fisker Inc. (2016–2024)

Fisker Inc. was founded in 2016 by designer Henrik Fisker, aiming to revive the dream of stylish and sustainable EVs after the collapse of his first venture, Fisker Automotive. Backed by a public SPAC listing in 2020, the company was valued at nearly $3 billion and promised to bring affordable, design-driven EVs to market.

Its first and only production model, the Fisker Ocean SUV, entered deliveries in 2023. While praised for its design and environmental branding, the Ocean quickly ran into trouble: software bugs, recalls, build-quality issues, and poor after-sales support. Customer confidence eroded, and cash flow dried up.

By early 2024, Fisker struggled to raise funds, with a potential partnership with another automaker collapsing. The company was delisted from the NYSE and left with mounting losses. On June 17, 2024, Fisker Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, listing up to $1 billion in assets and hundreds of millions in debt.

This marked the second collapse of a Fisker EV venture. Despite bold design and ambitious promises, Fisker Inc. ultimately failed to deliver a sustainable business model—leaving the Ocean as its sole legacy and customers facing an uncertain future.
