## Hongqi – China’s Flagship Luxury Brand

Hongqi, meaning “Red Flag” in Chinese, is one of the most prestigious and historically significant automobile brands in China. Founded in 1958 under the state-owned FAW Group, Hongqi was originally created to produce limousines and ceremonial vehicles for government officials and national events. For decades, Hongqi cars were a symbol of state power and pride, seen at parades and driven by China’s top leadership.

In recent years, Hongqi has undergone a dramatic transformation, evolving from a heritage limousine maker into a modern luxury car manufacturer with strong ambitions on the global stage. The brand has embraced electrification and intelligent technology as cornerstones of its strategy, unveiling a new design language that blends traditional Chinese cultural elements with futuristic styling.

Hongqi’s lineup now spans premium sedans, SUVs, and fully electric models. Key milestones include the launch of the E-HS9, a large luxury electric SUV, and the E-HS7, the first model built on the company’s dedicated Tiangong EV platform. This architecture, paired with Hongqi’s advanced Jiuzhang intelligent system, underpins the brand’s push toward smart, connected, and sustainable mobility.

The company has also expanded its presence internationally. Hongqi is no longer confined to the Chinese market; it now exports to Europe, the Middle East, and other regions, positioning itself as a competitor to established global luxury marques. Pre-sales of new models have even taken place at major international motor shows such as Paris and Geneva, signaling Hongqi’s intent to become a recognized global brand.

Today, Hongqi stands as both a guardian of Chinese automotive tradition and a pioneer of its electric future. Its vehicles emphasize luxury, advanced technology, and cultural identity, appealing to customers seeking something distinct in the premium EV landscape. With strong state backing and a growing portfolio of competitive electric vehicles, Hongqi is set to play a key role in shaping the future of high-end mobility, both in China and abroad.
