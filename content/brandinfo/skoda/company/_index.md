Škoda Auto is a renowned automobile manufacturer with a rich history and a promising future in the automotive industry. Headquartered in Mladá Boleslav, Czech Republic, Škoda has evolved from its humble beginnings to become a key player in the global market. This article explores Škoda's historical milestones, production facilities, ownership, and ambitious strategy for electrification.

## A Brief History

Škoda Auto's origins date back to 1895, when Václav Laurin and Václav Klement founded Laurin & Klement in Mladá Boleslav. Initially focused on producing bicycles, the company quickly transitioned to manufacturing motorcycles and, by 1905, had ventured into the automobile industry. The early 20th century saw Laurin & Klement become a notable name in the burgeoning car market.

In 1925, Laurin & Klement merged with the Škoda Works, an industrial conglomerate, and rebranded as Škoda Auto. This merger marked the beginning of a new era, with Škoda becoming a prominent name in the European automotive landscape. The company was nationalized after World War II and remained state-owned until the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.

The pivotal moment in Škoda's modern history came in 1991, when the Volkswagen Group acquired a stake in the company. By 2000, Volkswagen had become the full owner, integrating Škoda into its vast portfolio of automotive brands. This acquisition brought significant investment and technological advancements, propelling Škoda to new heights.
