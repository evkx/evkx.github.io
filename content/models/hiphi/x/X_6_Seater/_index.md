## Performance

The HiPhi X 6 Seater packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 433 kW (589 hp / 581 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 820 Nm (605 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 101 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97 kWh, providing a 4 kWh buffer (4.0%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 460 km (286 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.1 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 79 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed at 100 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 51%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 100 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 19 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 11 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 5% to 43%, with a total charging time of 111 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/hiphi/x/x_6_seater/charging_1_st.jpg" title="HiPhi X 6 Seater" width="3000" height="2000"  >}}

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. This model uses [**GBT**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#gbt) for China and Europe, meaning you must use a CCS2>GBT adapter in Europe. See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

The HiPhi X 6 Seater features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 150 mm, and the maximum is 200 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the HiPhi X 6 Seater. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

### Regenerative Braking

However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

## Exterior

The HiPhi X 6 Seater, with dimensions of 5200 mm in length,  mm in width, and 1618 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs You can choose between 5 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in front, a unique combination of suicide doors with a gullwing roof on the second row, and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate) in the rear. Powered doors are a standard function for the side doors.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic glass over first row in addition to the roof part of the gullving doors have glass. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
