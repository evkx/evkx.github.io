## Performance

The Renault Scenic E-Tech electric High Range offers modest performance with a maximum power of 160 kW (218 hp / 215 bhp) and a total torque of 300 Nm (221 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.4 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 91.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 87.0 kWh, providing a 4.0 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 625 to 622 km (388-387 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.9 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.0 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 130 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 74 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 38 minutes with an average charging speed of 96 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 96 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 58 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 51 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 1% to 56%, totaling 92 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 7.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 12 hours and 4 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
