## Performance

The Renault Scenic E-Tech electric High Range offers modest performance with a maximum power of 160 kW (218 hp / 215 bhp) and a total torque of 300 Nm (221 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.4 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 91 kWh and a net usable capacity of 87 kWh, providing an 4 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 625 to 622 km (388-387 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.9 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.0 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 130 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 63 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 107 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 98 kW, with each charging session taking about 28 minutes and 18 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 48 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 6% to 61%, with a total charging time of 88 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 7.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 12 hours and 4 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Exterior

The Renault Scenic E-Tech electric High Range, with dimensions of 4470 mm in length, 1864 mm in width, and 1571 mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. The Renault Scenic E-Tech electric High Range is available in a total of 6 solid paint colors.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Renault Scenic E-Tech electric High Range, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass in multiple patterns to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
