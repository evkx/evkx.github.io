## Performance

The Renault 5 E-Tech 52kWh 150hp offers modest performance with a maximum power of 110 kW (150 hp / 148 bhp) and a total torque of 245 Nm (181 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.9 seconds and has a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 55.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 52.0 kWh, providing a 3.0 kWh buffer (5.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 352 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 400 km (249 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 70 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 30 minutes with an average charging speed of 74 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 57%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 68 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 59 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 19.9 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 31 minutes, requiring five charging stops from 4% to 61%, totaling 132 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 7.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 13 minutes using a home setup.
