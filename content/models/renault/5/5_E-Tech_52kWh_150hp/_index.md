## Performance

The Renault 5 E-Tech 52kWh 150hp offers modest performance with a maximum power of 110 kW (150 hp / 148 bhp) and a total torque of 245 Nm (181 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.9 seconds and has a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 55 kWh and a net usable capacity of 52 kWh, providing an 3 kWh buffer (5.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 352 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 400 km (249 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 68 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed at 75 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 69 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 2 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 19.9 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 29 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 4% to 61%, with a total charging time of 130 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 7.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 13 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
