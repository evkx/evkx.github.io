## Performance

The Seres 5 4WD Premium packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 430 kW (585 hp / 577 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 940 Nm (694 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 80.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 78.0 kWh, providing a 2.0 kWh buffer (2.5%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 483 km (300 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 16.1 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 91 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed of 79 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 61%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 79 kW, with each charging session taking about 32 minutes and 51 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 32 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 6% to 62%, with a total charging time of 132 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 5 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Seres 5 4WD Premium features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 185 mm.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Seres 5 4WD Premium, with dimensions of 4710 mm in length, 1930 mm in width, and 1620 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The Seres 5 4WD Premium is available in a total of 8 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

The Seres 5 4WD Premium offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
