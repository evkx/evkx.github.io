We've organized this article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. Additionally, we offer an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections include:

## Performance

The Fiat Grande Panda kWh provides basic performance with a maximum power of 83 kW (113 hp / 111 bhp) and a total torque of 120 Nm (89 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 11 seconds and reaches a top speed of 135 km/h (84 mph), which is more comparable to entry-level traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 45.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 44.0 kWh, providing a 1.0 kWh buffer (2.2%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 320 km (199 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 66 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 25 minutes with an average charging speed of 73 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 13% to 68%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 64 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 34 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 23 minutes. This journey would require eight charging stops from 13% to 69%, with a total charging time of 184 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 7.4 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 56 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/fiat/grande_panda/grande_panda/charging_1_st.JPG" title="Fiat Grande Panda" width="3000" height="1999"  >}}

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Fiat Grande Panda has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 163 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Fiat Grande Panda, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Fiat Grande Panda is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

The Fiat Grande Panda offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 205/55 tires on 16" rims
- 205/50 tires on 17" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
