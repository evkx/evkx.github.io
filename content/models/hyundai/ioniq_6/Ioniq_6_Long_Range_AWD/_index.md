## Performance

The Hyundai Ioniq 6 Long Range AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 239 kW (325 hp / 321 bhp) and a total torque of 605 Nm (446 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.1 seconds and reaches a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 77.4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74.0 kWh, providing a 3.4 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 697 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 583 to 519 km (362-323 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 12.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.3 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 38 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed of 192 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 152 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 59 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Hyundai Ioniq 6 Long Range AWD a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 15 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 1% to 63%, with a total charging time of 56 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
