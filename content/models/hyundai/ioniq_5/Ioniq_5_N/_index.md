## Performance

With overboost, the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N reaches a maximum power of 478 kW (650 hp / 641 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 448 kW (609 hp / 601 bhp). The maxium torque is at 770 Nm (568 lb-ft). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 84 kWh and a net usable capacity of 80 kWh, providing a 4 kWh buffer (4.8%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 697 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 450 km (280 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 17.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 41 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 18 minutes with an average charging speed of 192 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 154 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 21 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 30 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 1% to 76%, with a total charging time of 70 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 16 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
