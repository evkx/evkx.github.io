## Performance

The Hyundai IONIQ 9 AWD Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 230 kW (313 hp / 308 bhp) and a total torque of 605 Nm (446 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.2 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 110.3 kWh and a net usable capacity of 107.0 kWh, providing a 3.3 kWh buffer (3.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 610 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 570 km (354 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 18.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 74 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 27 minutes with an average charging speed of 169 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 71%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 153 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 59 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Hyundai IONIQ 9 AWD Performance a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 20 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 2% to 74%, totaling 61 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 9 hours and 43 minutes using a home setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/hyundai/ioniq_9/ioniq_9_awd_performance/charging_1_st.jpg" title="Hyundai IONIQ 9 AWD Performance" width="3000" height="1913"  >}}

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
