## Performance

The Hyundai INSTER Standard Range kWh provides basic performance with a maximum power of 71 kW (97 hp / 95 bhp) and a total torque of 147 Nm (108 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 11.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 140 km/h (87 mph), which is more comparable to entry-level traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 41 kWh and a net usable capacity of 39 kWh, providing an 2 kWh buffer (4.9%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 280 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 300 km (187 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 80 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 54 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 25 minutes with an average charging speed at 65 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 67%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 62 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 58 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 28 minutes. This journey would require eight charging stops from 5% to 67%, with a total charging time of 189 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 3 hours and 32 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 254mm, and the rear discs are 240mm.

### Regenerative braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

The Hyundai INSTER Standard Range, with dimensions of 3825 mm in length, 1610 mm in width, and 1610 mm in height, falls into the Mini-segment cars, often referred to as city cars or A-segment cars, are the smallest class of cars.
