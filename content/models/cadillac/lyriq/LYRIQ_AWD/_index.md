## Performance

The Cadillac LYRIQ AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 384 kW (522 hp / 515 bhp) and a total torque of 610 Nm (450 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 112.5 kWh and a net usable capacity of 107.5 kWh, providing a 5.0 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 355.2 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 326 to 307 miles (525-494 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 3.0 mi/kWh for the base model and 2.9 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 190 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 190 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed of 133 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 8% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 119 kW, with each charging session taking about 31 minutes and 50 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 33 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 6% to 73%, totaling 73 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 9 hours and 20 minutes using a home setup. An optional 19.2 kW onboard charger reduces the full charge time to approximately 5 hours and 35 minutes.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
