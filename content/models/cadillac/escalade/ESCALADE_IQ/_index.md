## Performance

The Cadillac ESCALADE IQ packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 560 kW (761 hp / 751 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1064 Nm (785 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.7 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 215 kWh and a net usable capacity of 200 kWh, providing an 15 kWh buffer (7.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 650 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 450 miles (724 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.3 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 130 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 45 minutes with an average charging speed at 186 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 53%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 242 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 49 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the Cadillac ESCALADE IQ a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 35 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 58 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 39%, with a total charging time of 39 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 19.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 25 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Cadillac ESCALADE IQ features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 125 mm, and the maximum is 200 mm. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

### Regenerative braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal).

The maximum regenerative power is 400 kW.

## Exterior

The Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, with dimensions of 5697 mm in length, 2167 mm in width, and 1934 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs The Cadillac ESCALADE IQ is available in a total of 1 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.
