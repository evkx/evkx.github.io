## Performance

The Cadillac ESCALADE IQ packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 560 kW (761 hp / 751 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1064 Nm (785 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 225.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 215.0 kWh, providing a 10.0 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 355 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 460 miles (740 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.1 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 143 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 50 minutes with an average charging speed of 182 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 48%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 241 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 10 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Cadillac ESCALADE IQ a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 35 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 8 hours and 53 minutes, requiring one charging stops from 0% to 63%, totaling 34 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 18 hours and 41 minutes using a home setup. An optional 19.2 kW onboard charger reduces the full charge time to approximately 11 hours and 11 minutes.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports both V2L (Vehicle to Load) and V2H (Vehicle to Home) functionalities. V2L allows you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 10.2 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles. V2H enables the car to serve as a backup power source for your home. You can connect equipment using a adapter on the charging port and via standard connectors in the cabin. Note that V2H requires specialized equipment in your home.

However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes and **Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 400 kW.
