## Performance

The Hongqi E-HS9 Exclusive+ packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 405 kW (551 hp / 543 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 670 Nm (494 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 120.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 110.0 kWh, providing a 10.0 kWh buffer (8.3%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 515 km (320 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 21.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 114 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 62 minutes with an average charging speed of 74 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 39%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 87 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 35 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 32 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 46 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 1% to 33%, with a total charging time of 147 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 0 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
