## Performance

The Hongqi E-HS9 Premium packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 405 kW (551 hp / 543 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 670 Nm (494 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 99.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 95.3 kWh, providing a 3.7 kWh buffer (3.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 410 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 465 km (289 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 20.5 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 80 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 38 minutes with an average charging speed of 105 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 8% to 68%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 94 kW, with each charging session taking about 36 minutes and 30 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 32 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 43 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 8% to 67%, totaling 144 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 39 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
