## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 80.1 kWh and a net usable capacity of 77.0 kWh, providing a 3.1 kWh buffer (3.9%) for battery protection.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 710 km (441 miles). The energy consumption is 10.8 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 42 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed of 136 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 123 kW, with each charging session taking about 21 minutes and 57 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 20 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 20 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 3% to 57%, totaling 61 minutes of charging time.
