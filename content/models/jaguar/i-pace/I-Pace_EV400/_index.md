## Performance

The Jaguar I-Pace EV400 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 294 kW (400 hp / 394 bhp) and a total torque of 696 Nm (514 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 90.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 84.7 kWh, providing a 5.3 kWh buffer (5.9%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 470 to 408 km (292-254 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 18.0 kWh/100 km for the base model and 20.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 104 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 107 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 50 minutes with an average charging speed of 71 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 46%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 75 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 29 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 26.9 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 50 minutes, requiring five charging stops from 6% to 50%, totaling 150 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 42 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

- 245/55 tires on 19" rims
- 245/50 tires on 20" rims
- 255/40 tires on 22" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The tailgate is electrically powered.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
