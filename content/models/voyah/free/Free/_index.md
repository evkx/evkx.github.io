## Performance

The VOYAH FREE delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 360 kW (490 hp / 483 bhp) and a total torque of 720 Nm (531 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 106.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 100.0 kWh, providing a 6.0 kWh buffer (5.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 500 km (311 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 20.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 95 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 51 minutes with an average charging speed of 83 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 74%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 76 kW, with each charging session taking about 55 minutes and 13 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 18 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 1% to 76%, totaling 119 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 9 hours and 5 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. <ul><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

If you lift away the foot completely the regen is at one fixed level. This can't be adjusted.
