We've organized this article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. Additionally, we offer an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections include:

## Performance

The VOYAH Courage AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 320 kW (435 hp / 429 bhp) and a total torque of 620 Nm (458 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 204 km/h (127 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 77.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 76.0 kWh, providing a 1.0 kWh buffer (1.3%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 440 km (274 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 17.3 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 73 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 38 minutes with an average charging speed of 83 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 74%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 74 kW, with each charging session taking about 44 minutes and 23 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 25 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 5% to 73%, with a total charging time of 126 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 54 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger.

## Drivetrain

The VOYAH Courage AWD features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the VOYAH Courage AWD, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The VOYAH Courage AWD lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 6 modes:

- Performance: Dynamic steering, suspension and throttle. - Eco: Balanced steering, with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension. - Comfort: Balanced throttle and steering, comfort suspension damping. - Outing: Balanced throttle and steering, comfort suspension damping. - Snow: Balanced steering, throttle and damping. - Individual: User-defined settings for steering, throttle, and suspension.

### Brakes

The VOYAH Courage AWD is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 350 mm, while the rear discs are 350 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. <ul><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

If you lift away the foot completely the regen is at one fixed level. This can't be adjusted.

## Exterior

The VOYAH Courage AWD, with dimensions of 4725 mm in length, 1900 mm in width, and 1653 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
