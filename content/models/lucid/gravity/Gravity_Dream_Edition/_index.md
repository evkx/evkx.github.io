## Performance

The Lucid Gravity Dream Edition packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 600 kW (816 hp / 805 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1000 Nm (738 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 122.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 120.0 kWh, providing a 2.0 kWh buffer (1.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 800 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 440 miles (708 km) with an energy consumption rate of 3.7 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 75 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 30 minutes with an average charging speed of 171 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 176 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 25 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Lucid Gravity Dream Edition a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 8 hours and 51 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 0% to 38%, totaling 31 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 27 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Lucid Gravity Dream Edition features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 155 mm.

You can order Lucid Gravity Dream Edition with an alternative  suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 155 mm, and the maximum is 220 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Lucid Gravity Dream Edition, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Lucid Gravity Dream Edition is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 386 mm, while the rear discs are 381 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

## Exterior

The Lucid Gravity Dream Edition, with dimensions of 5034 mm in length, 1999 mm in width, and 1656 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs The Lucid Gravity Dream Edition is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

The Lucid Gravity Dream Edition offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/50 tires on 20" rims front and 285/45 tires on 21" rims rear
- 265/45 tires on 21" rims front and 285/40 tires on 22" rims rear
- 265/40 tires on 21" rims front and 285/35 tires on 23" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model. The windshield is panoramic going back over the first row. In addition there is glasspanel over the second row. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
