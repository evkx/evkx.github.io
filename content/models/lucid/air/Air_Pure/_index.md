## Performance

The Lucid Air Pure delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 320.5 kW (436 hp / 430 bhp) and a total torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 88.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 84.0 kWh, providing a 4.0 kWh buffer (4.5%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 800 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 747 to 708 km (464-440 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 11.2 kWh/100 km for the base model and 11.9 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 57 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed of 147 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 50%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 156 kW, with each charging session taking about 16 minutes and 51 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 19 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 2 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 1% to 44%, totaling 42 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 3 hours and 49 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Lucid Air Pure has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 126 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Lucid Air Pure, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Lucid Air Pure is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 380 mm, while the rear discs are 375 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.
