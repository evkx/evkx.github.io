## Performance

The Lucid Air Dream Edition Range delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 696 KW (946 hp/933 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1390 Nm (1026 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.9 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 270 km/h (168 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 118.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 117.0 kWh, providing a 1.0 kWh buffer (0.8%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 800 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 883 to 828 km (549-515 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.3 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.1 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. This range is amongst the longest in its class, and the high efficiency makes it one of the most economical vehicles in its category. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 73 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed of 171 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 175 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 5 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Lucid Air Dream Edition Range a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 19 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 8 hours and 46 minutes, requiring one charging stops from 0% to 63%, totaling 27 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 19 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
