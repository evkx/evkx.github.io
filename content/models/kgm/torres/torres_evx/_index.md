## Performance

The KGM Torres EVX offers modest performance with a maximum power of 152.2 kW (207 hp / 204 bhp) and a total torque of 339 Nm (250 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.1 seconds and has a top speed of 175 km/h (109 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 75.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 73.4 kWh, providing a 1.6 kWh buffer (2.1%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 462 km (287 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 120 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 84 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 33 minutes with an average charging speed of 93 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 64%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 89 kW, with each charging session taking about 31 minutes and 49 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 27 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 1% to 65%, totaling 128 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 6 hours and 40 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. A second port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

<a id="section-drivetrain" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Drivetrain

The KGM Torres EVX has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 175 mm.

### Brakes

The KGM Torres EVX is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 260 mm, while the rear discs are 260 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The KGM Torres EVX, with dimensions of 4715 mm in length,  mm in width, and 1725 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The KGM Torres EVX is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

The KGM Torres EVX offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 225/60 tires on 18" rims
- 245/45 tires on 20" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard is just a regular roof.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
