## Performance

The KGM Torres EVX offers modest performance with a maximum power of 152.2 kW (207 hp / 204 bhp) and a total torque of 339 Nm (250 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.1 seconds and has a top speed of 175 km/h (109 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 75 kWh and a net usable capacity of 73,4 kWh, providing an 1,6 kWh buffer (2.1%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery uses [LFP technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp) This has some benefits and disadvantages from the typical NCA/NCM batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 462 km (287 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 120 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 82 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 95 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 64%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 90 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 16 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 25 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 1% to 65%, with a total charging time of 125 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. A second port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

KGM Torres EVX has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 175 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 260mm, and the rear discs are 260mm.

### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The KGM Torres EVX, with dimensions of 4715 mm in length,  mm in width, and 1725 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs, also known as C-SUVs, offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUV The KGM Torres EVX is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the KGM Torres EVX, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 225/60 tires on 18" rims
- 245/45 tires on 20" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof for this model. The standard is just a regular roof.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.

## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The trunk offers a cargo capacity of 703 liters (24.8 CU FT). With the rear seat folded down, this expands to 1662 liters (58.7 CU FT). On the roof, you can load up to 75 kg (165.3 lbs). Roof rails are standard for easy mounting of a roof box or rack.

The vehicle’s maximum weight is 2410 kg (5313 lbs), with a base weight of 1915 kg (4222 lbs). This allows for a maximum load of 495 kg (1091 lbs), including the driver and passengers. Note that some options may increase the base weight and reduce the maximum loading capacity. 495kg is considered low for this type of car and might restrict how much stuff you can bring in addition to passengers.
