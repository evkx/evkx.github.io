## Performance

The Tesla Model Y Long Range RWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 250 kW (340 hp / 335 bhp) and a total torque of 450 Nm (332 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 217 km/h (135 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82 kWh and a net usable capacity of 79 kWh, providing an 3 kWh buffer (3.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 357 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 600 km (373 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.2 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 65 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 33 minutes with an average charging speed at 101 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 111 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 8 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 19.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 23 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 5% to 42%, with a total charging time of 64 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 10 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The charge port is conveniently located at the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner) of the vehicle, facilitating easy access when backing into charging stations. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Tesla Model Y Long Range RWD features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 167 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Tesla Model Y Long Range RWD. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 355mm, and the rear discs are 335mm.

### Regenerative braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. This model offers three stopping modes for one-pedal driving: <ul><li>**Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes</li><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior
