## Performance

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 324 kW (441 hp / 435 bhp) and a total torque of 493 Nm (364 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82 kWh and a net usable capacity of 75 kWh, providing a 7 kWh buffer (8.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 357 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 629 km (391 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 11.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 68 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed at 97 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 119 kW, with each charging session taking about 14 minutes and 23 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 17.3 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 10 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 5% to 38%, with a total charging time of 51 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located at the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner) of the vehicle, facilitating easy access when backing into charging stations. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Tesla Model 3 Long Range. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 355mm, and the rear discs are 355mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. This model offers three stopping modes for one-pedal driving: <ul><li>**Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes</li><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Tesla Model 3 Long Range, with dimensions of 4694 mm in length, 1849 mm in width, and 1443 mm in height, falls into D-segment cars, also known as mid-size or family cars, offer more space, comfort, and features than smaller segments, making them suitable for a variety of drivers. The Tesla Model 3 Long Range is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Tesla Model 3 Long Range, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/45 tires on 18" rims
- 255/45 tires on 19" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
