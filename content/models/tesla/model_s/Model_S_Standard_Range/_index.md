## Performance

The Tesla Model S Standard Range delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 381 kW (518 hp / 511 bhp) and a total torque of 700 Nm (517 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 75.0 kWh, providing a 25.0 kWh buffer (25.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 407 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 512 to 500 km (318-311 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.0 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 62 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed of 132 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 50%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 132 kW, with each charging session taking about 15 minutes and 20 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 19.7 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 16 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 7% to 48%, with a total charging time of 56 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located at the [left rear corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-corner) of the vehicle, facilitating easy access when backing into charging stations. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**NACS**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#nacs) for North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Tesla Model S Standard Range features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 117 mm, and the maximum is 158 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Tesla Model S Standard Range, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 355 mm, while the rear discs are 355 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. This model offers three stopping modes for one-pedal driving: <ul><li>**Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes</li><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Tesla Model S Standard Range, with dimensions of 5021 mm in length, 1987 mm in width, and 1431 mm in height, falls into F-segment cars, also known as luxury or full-size luxury cars, represent the pinnacle of automotive luxury, performance, and technology. They are typically large sedans or limousines and are designed to offer the utmost in comfort, prestige, and advanced features. The Tesla Model S Standard Range is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

The Tesla Model S Standard Range offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/35 tires on 21" rims front and 295/30 tires on 21" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
