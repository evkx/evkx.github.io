## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 580 4MATIC SUV packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 400 kW (544 hp / 536 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 858 Nm (633 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.6 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 125.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 118.0 kWh, providing a 7.0 kWh buffer (5.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 396 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 673 to 594 km (418-369 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.5 kWh/100 km for the base model and 19.9 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 91 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 33 minutes with an average charging speed of 150 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 55%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 142 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 59 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 32 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 1% to 49%, with a total charging time of 72 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 580 4MATIC SUV features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 181 mm, and the maximum is 206 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Mercedes-EQ EQS 580 4MATIC SUV, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 415 mm, while the rear discs are 378 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

The maximum regenerative power is 300 kW.

## Exterior

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 580 4MATIC SUV, with dimensions of 5125 mm in length, 1959 mm in width, and 1718 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs The Mercedes-EQ EQS 580 4MATIC SUV offers a selection of 9 paint colors, including solid and metallic options.

- 265/45 tires on 21" rims
- 265/40 tires on 22" rims front and 295/40 tires on 22" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
