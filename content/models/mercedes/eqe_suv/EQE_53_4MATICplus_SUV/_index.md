## Performance

The Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ SUV packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 460 kW (625 hp / 617 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 950 Nm (701 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.7 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 220 km/h (137 mph), making it a standout in its class.

If you are not happy enough with the standard performance, you can add the AMG Dynamic Plus performance option. Then the numbers are improved. The Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ SUV packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 505 kW (687 hp / 677 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1000 Nm (738 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 240 km/h (149 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 96.1 kWh and a net usable capacity of 90.6 kWh, providing a 5.5 kWh buffer (5.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 328 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 470 to 375 km (292-233 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 19.3 kWh/100 km for the base model and 24.2 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 170 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 57 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed of 129 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 63%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 119 kW, with each charging session taking about 28 minutes and 50 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 27 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 52 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 2% to 69%, totaling 92 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 14 minutes using a home setup. An optional 22 kW onboard charger reduces the full charge time to approximately 4 hours and 7 minutes.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ SUV features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 154 mm, and the maximum is 204 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ SUV, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The second option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes).

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

## Exterior

The Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ SUV, with dimensions of 4879 mm in length, 1931 mm in width, and 1672 mm in height, falls into the Mid-size SUVs offer a blend of space, comfort, performance, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of drivers with diverse needs.

 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 


The optional AMG Night Package finishes selected exterior elements in high-gloss black. Depending on the chosen paint color – this results in either strong contrasts or flowing transitions. 

The Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ SUV offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/40 tires on 20" rims front and 295/35 tires on 20" rims rear
- 265/35 tires on 21" rims front and 295/30 tires on 21" rims rear
- 265/35 tires on 22" rims front and 295/30 tires on 22" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
