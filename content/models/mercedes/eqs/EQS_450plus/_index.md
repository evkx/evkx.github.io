## Performance

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+ delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 265 kW (360 hp / 355 bhp) and a total torque of 800 Nm (590 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 120.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 108.4 kWh, providing a 11.6 kWh buffer (9.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 396 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 783 to 642 km (487-399 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.8 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.9 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 210 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 82 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 30 minutes with an average charging speed of 153 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 57%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 142 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 41 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+ a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 19.8 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 59 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 43%, with a total charging time of 40 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 55 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+ has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 82 mm, and the maximum is 127 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 415 mm, while the rear discs are 378 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

The maximum regenerative power is 300 kW.

## Exterior

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+, with dimensions of 5216 mm in length, 1926 mm in width, and 1512 mm in height, falls into F-segment cars, also known as luxury or full-size luxury cars, represent the pinnacle of automotive luxury, performance, and technology. They are typically large sedans or limousines and are designed to offer the utmost in comfort, prestige, and advanced features.

Alongside the standard palette, exclusive colors are available from the 'MANUFAKTUR' palette.

You can also choose from several styling options to make your car more unique.
 In addition, you can equip this model with an AMG line exterior package. This package gives a more sporty design with a sporty diffusor and a new twin blade grill. 

The Mercedes-EQ EQS 450+ offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims
- 265/40 tires on 21" rims front and 295/35 tires on 21" rims rear
- 265/40 tires on 20" rims front and 295/35 tires on 20" rims rear
- 265/35 tires on 22" rims front and 295/30 tires on 22" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate), which makes the trunk much more usable compared to a traditional bootlid, especially for a sedan. The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
