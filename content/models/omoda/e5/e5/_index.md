## Performance

The OMODA E5 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 340 Nm (251 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.6 seconds and has a top speed of 172 km/h (107 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 61.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 60.0 kWh, providing a 1.0 kWh buffer (1.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 370 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 430 km (267 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 80 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 100 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 40 minutes with an average charging speed of 64 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 12% to 71%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 60 kW, with each charging session taking about 36 minutes and 36 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 11 hours and 12 minutes, requiring five charging stops from 13% to 70%, totaling 172 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 9.9 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 6 hours and 3 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.3 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.

## Drivetrain

The OMODA E5 has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 180 mm.

### Drive Modes

The OMODA E5 lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 3 modes:

- Normal: Balanced steering and throttle.
- Sport: Dynamic steering and throttle.
- Eco: Balanced steering and efficent throttle.

### Brakes

The OMODA E5 uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The OMODA E5, with dimensions of 4424 mm in length, 1830 mm in width, and 1588 mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. The OMODA E5 is available in a total of 10 paint colors, including several striking metallic options. Some of these paint options include two-tone paints where the roof and upper part of the body are painted in a different color, providing a distinctive and stylish look.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has manual curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
