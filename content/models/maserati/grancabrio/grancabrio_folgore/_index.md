## Performance

The Maserati GranCabrio Folgore packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 410 kW (557 hp / 550 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 820 Nm (605 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.1 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 220 km/h (137 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 105 kWh and a net usable capacity of 96 kWh, providing a 9 kWh buffer (8.6%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 501 to 426 km (311-265 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 19.2 kWh/100 km for the base model and 22.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 64 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 118 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 61%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 112 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 22 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 29 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 5 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 3% to 54%, with a total charging time of 106 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 21 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Maserati GranCabrio Folgore features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 145 mm, and the maximum is 205 mm.

### Drive Modes

The Maserati GranCabrio Folgore lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 4 modes:

- Sport: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Max Range: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- GT: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Off Road: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 350mm, and the rear discs are 350mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Maserati GranCabrio Folgore is available in a total of 8 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Maserati GranCabrio Folgore, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims front and 295/40 tires on 20" rims rear
- 255/40 tires on 21" rims front and 295/35 tires on 21" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
