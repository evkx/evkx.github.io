## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 92.2 kWh and a net usable capacity of 83.0 kWh, providing a 9.2 kWh buffer (10.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 800 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 501 to 426 km (311-265 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 19.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 40 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 22 minutes with an average charging speed of 161 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 55%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 161 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 45 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Maserati GranTurismo Folgore a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 29 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 38 minutes, requiring five charging stops from 2% to 52%, totaling 78 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 3 hours and 46 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

- Sport: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Max Range: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- GT: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.

### Brakes

The Maserati GranTurismo Folgore is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 380 mm, while the rear discs are 350 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 400 kW.
