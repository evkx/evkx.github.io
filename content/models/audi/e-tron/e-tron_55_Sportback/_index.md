## Performance

With overboost, the Audi e-tron 55 Sportback reaches a maximum power of 300 kW (408 hp / 402 bhp). Without overboost, it delivers 265 kW (360 hp / 355 bhp). The maximum torque is 664 Nm (490 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), demonstrating its solid performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 95.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 86.0 kWh, providing a 9.0 kWh buffer (9.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 396 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 452 to 373 km (281-232 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 19.0 kWh/100 km for the base model and 23.1 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 44 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 26 minutes with an average charging speed of 139 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 81%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 118 kW, with each charging session taking about 34 minutes and 14 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 50 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 12% to 80%, with a total charging time of 91 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 3 hours and 54 minutes at home.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. A second port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Audi e-tron 55 Sportback features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 152 mm, and the maximum is 248 mm.

You can order Audi e-tron 55 Sportback with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension Sport suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 152 mm, and the maximum is 248 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Audi e-tron 55 Sportback, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The Audi e-tron 55 Sportback lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 7 modes:

- Dynamic: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Efficiency: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Comfort: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Allroad: Balanced steering, high suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Offroad: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Auto: Balanced steering, adaptive suspension height with balanced throttle, and adaptive suspension damping.
- Custom: User-defined settings for steering, suspension, and throttle response.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 375 mm, while the rear discs are 350 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Audi e-tron 55 Sportback, with dimensions of 4901 mm in length, 1935 mm in width, and 1616 mm in height, falls into the Mid-size SUVs offer a blend of space, comfort, performance, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of drivers with diverse needs.

- 265/45 tires on 21" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate). Soft close is an optional function for the side doors.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
