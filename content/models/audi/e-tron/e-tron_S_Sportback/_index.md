## Performance

With overboost, the Audi e-tron S Sportback reaches a maximum power of 370 kW (503 hp / 496 bhp). Without overboost, it delivers 320 kW (435 hp / 429 bhp). The maximum torque is 973 Nm (718 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), demonstrating its solid performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 95 kWh and a net usable capacity of 86 kWh, providing an 9 kWh buffer (9.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 396 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 379 to 347 km (236-216 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 22.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 24.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 44 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 26 minutes with an average charging speed at 139 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 81%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 118 kW, with each charging session taking about 34 minutes and 14 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 0 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 4% to 80%, with a total charging time of 100 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 3 hours and 54 minutes at home.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. A second port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Audi e-tron S Sportback has an all-wheel drive system supported by three motors. One on front axle, and two on rear axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).


### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 152 mm, and the maximum is 248 mm.

You can order Audi e-tron S Sportback with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension Sport suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 152 mm, and the maximum is 248 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Audi e-tron S Sportback. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Drive modes

The Audi e-tron S Sportback lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 7 modes:

- Dynamic: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Efficiency: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Comfort: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Allroad: Balanced steering, high suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Offroad: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Auto: Balanced steering, adaptive suspension height with balanced throttle, and adaptive suspension damping.
- Custom: Custom-defined steering, suspension, and throttle response.


### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 375mm, and the rear discs are 350mm.


### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.
