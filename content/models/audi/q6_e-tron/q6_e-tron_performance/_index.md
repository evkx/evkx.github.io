## Performance

The Audi Q6 e-tron performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 240 kW (326 hp / 322 bhp) and a total torque of 485 Nm (358 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100 kWh and a net usable capacity of 94,9 kWh, providing an 5,1 kWh buffer (5.1%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 662 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 641 to 556 km (398-346 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels, for instance, can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.8 kWh/100 km for the base model and 17.1 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 57 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 20 minutes with an average charging speed at 196 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 63%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 170 kW, with each charging session taking about 20 minutes and 4 seconds.. This efficient charging capability makes the Audi Q6 e-tron performance a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 2 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 3% to 67%, with a total charging time of 43 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 37 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 4 hours and 18 minutes at home.
