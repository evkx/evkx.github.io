## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 105.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97.0 kWh, providing a 8.0 kWh buffer (7.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 725 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 598 to 527 km (372-328 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.2 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.4 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 320 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 47 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed of 260 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 209 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 48 seconds. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Audi RS e-tron GT performance one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 8 hours and 55 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 1% to 65%, totaling 36 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 49 minutes using a home setup. An optional 22 kW onboard charger reduces the full charge time to approximately 4 hours and 24 minutes.

## Drivetrain

The Audi RS e-tron GT performance features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 125 mm, and the maximum is 165 mm.

You can order Audi RS e-tron GT performance with an alternative Active suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and active hydraulic dampers. The damper actively suppresses undesired motion of the air suspension. This allows the wheels to be actively pushed into the road or pulled into the body at any time. With a smooth ride, the system absorbs bumps almost completely. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 125 mm, and the maximum is 165 mm.

The Active Suspension maintains the car's body nearly horizontal during dynamic braking, steering, and acceleration, enhancing precise steering response and driver control..

Normally, cars lean outward in corners. However, the active cornering dynamics can counteract this roll, or even overcompensate, making the car lean into bends like a motorcycle.

The Easy Entry function raises the car's body automatically when a door is opened, facilitating easier entry and exit. Once the door closes, the body returns to its previous level.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Audi RS e-tron GT performance, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs measure 360 mm, while the rear discs are 358 mm. The second option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs measure 410 mm, while the rear discs are 365 mm. The third option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs measure 420 mm, while the rear discs are 410 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 265 kW.
