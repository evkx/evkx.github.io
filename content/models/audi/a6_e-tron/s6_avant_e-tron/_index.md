## Performance

With overboost, the Audi S6 Avant e-tron reaches a maximum power of 405 kW (551 hp / 543 bhp). Without overboost, it provides a strong 370 kW (503 hp / 496 bhp). The maxium torque is at 855 Nm (631 lb-ft). This powerhouse can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 240 km/h (149 mph), showcasing its impressive performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100 kWh and a net usable capacity of 94,9 kWh, providing a 5,1 kWh buffer (5.1%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 662 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 647 to 609 km (402-379 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.6 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 59 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 20 minutes with an average charging speed of 196 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 64%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 171 kW, with each charging session taking about 21 minutes and 56 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Audi S6 Avant e-tron a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 0 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 62%, with a total charging time of 41 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 37 minutes using a home charging setup. For faster charging, you can opt for an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22 kW. With this upgrade, you can achieve a full charge from 0 to 100% in just about 4 hours and 18 minutes at home.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. Additionally, a second port on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side) offers greater flexibility for AC charging. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Audi S6 Avant e-tron features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension and rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 105 mm, and the maximum is 145 mm.

For easier loading, you can lower the air suspension from the rear

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Audi S6 Avant e-tron. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Drive Modes

The Audi S6 Avant e-tron lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 5 modes:

- Dynamic: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Efficiency: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Comfort: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Balanced: Balanced steering, adaptive suspension height with balanced throttle, and adaptive suspension damping.
- Individual: Custom-defined steering, suspension, and throttle response.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 400 mm, and the rear discs are 350 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. This model offers three stopping modes for one-pedal driving: <ul><li>**Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes</li><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 220 kW.

## Exterior

The Audi S6 Avant e-tron, with dimensions of 4928 mm in length, 1923 mm in width, and 1527 mm in height, falls into E-segment cars, also known as executive cars, are larger and more luxurious than their D-segment counterparts.

- 245/40 tires on 21" rims front and 275/35 tires on 21" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close is an optional function for the side doors.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass in multiple levels to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
