## Performance

The Kia EV3 Long Range offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 283 Nm (209 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.5 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 81.4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 77.0 kWh, providing a 4.4 kWh buffer (5.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 358 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 600 km (373 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 12.8 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 128 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 70 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 31 minutes with an average charging speed of 105 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 10% to 71%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 95 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 44 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 20 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 40 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 11% to 65%, totaling 80 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 0 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Exterior

The Kia EV3 Long Range, with dimensions of 4300 mm in length, 1850 mm in width, and 1560 mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. You can choose between 11 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The Kia EV3 Long Range offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. The standard roof has a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
