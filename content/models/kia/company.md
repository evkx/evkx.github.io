### Kia: A Journey from Humble Beginnings to a Leader in EV Innovation

**Kia Corporation**, founded in 1944, has grown from a modest manufacturer of bicycles and steel tubing in Korea to a global automotive powerhouse. Today, it stands as a significant player in the electric vehicle (EV) market, pushing boundaries with innovative designs and sustainable technology.

#### **History of Kia**

Kia's story began in **Seoul, South Korea**, where it was originally established as **Kyungsung Precision Industry**. In the early years, the company focused on producing bicycle parts and later, complete bicycles—the first of their kind in Korea.

In the 1970s, Kia moved into automobile manufacturing, initially producing small trucks and motorcycles. A significant milestone was achieved in **1974**, when Kia built its first automotive assembly plant, the **Sohari Plant**, and launched its first car, the **Brisa**.

The 1990s were challenging for Kia due to the Asian financial crisis, leading to bankruptcy in 1997. Hyundai Motor Company acquired a controlling interest in Kia in **1998**, forming the **Hyundai Motor Group**, one of the world's largest automotive groups today.
