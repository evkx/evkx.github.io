## Performance

The Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 283 kW (385 hp / 380 bhp) and a total torque of 700 Nm (517 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.3 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 99.8 kWh and a net usable capacity of 98.0 kWh, providing a 1.8 kWh buffer (1.8%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 552 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 512 to 505 km (318-314 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 19.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 19.4 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 68 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed of 169 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 71%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 150 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 58 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 27 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 5% to 61%, with a total charging time of 67 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 54 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports both V2L (Vehicle to Load) and V2H (Vehicle to Home) functionalities. V2L allows you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.68 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles. V2H enables the car to serve as a backup power source for your home.

## Drivetrain

The Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 7 modes:

- Eco: Balanced steering, with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Sport: Dynamic steering, suspension and throttle.
- Normal: Balanced throttle and steering, comfort suspension damping.
- My Drive: User-defined settings for steering, throttle, and suspension.
- Snow: Balanced steering, throttle and damping.
- Mud: Balanced steering, throttle and damping.
- Sand: Balanced steering, throttle and damping.

### Brakes

The Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 360 mm, while the rear discs are 340 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are four levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 150 kW.

## Exterior

The Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD, with dimensions of 5015 mm in length, 1980 mm in width, and 1780 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs The Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD offers a selection of 10 paint colors, featuring solid, metallic, pearlescent, and matte options.

The Kia EV9 GT-Line AWD offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims
- 285/45 tires on 21" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
