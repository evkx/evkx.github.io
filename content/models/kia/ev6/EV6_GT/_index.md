## Performance

The Kia EV6 GT packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 430 kW (585 hp / 577 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 740 Nm (546 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 260 km/h (162 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 77.4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74.0 kWh, providing a 3.4 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 697 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 424 km (264 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 17.5 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 38 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed of 192 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 152 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 59 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Kia EV6 GT a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 32 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 1% to 83%, with a total charging time of 72 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Kia EV6 GT features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.

### Suspension

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen.

The maximum regenerative power is 150 kW.

## Exterior

The Kia EV6 GT, with dimensions of 4680 mm in length, 1880 mm in width, and 1550 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. You can choose between 8 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the Kia EV6 GT, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/40 tires on 21" rims

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.

## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The trunk offers a cargo capacity of 480 liters (17.0 CU FT). With the rear seat folded down, this expands to 1260 liters (44.5 CU FT). On the roof, you can load up to 80 kg (176.4 lbs). Roof rails are standard for easy mounting of a roof box or rack. Additionally, there is a frunk (front trunk) with a storage capacity of 20 liters (0.7 CU FT).

The vehicle’s maximum weight is 2610 kg (5754 lbs), with a base weight of 2125 kg (4685 lbs). This allows for a maximum load of 485 kg (1069 lbs), including the driver and passengers. Note that some options may increase the base weight and reduce the maximum loading capacity. 485kg is considered low for this type of car and might restrict how much stuff you can bring in addition to passengers.

A towbar can be added to the vehicle. The maximum permissible weight for a braked trailer is 1600 kg (3527 lbs), while for an unbraked trailer, it is 750 kg (1653 lbs).
