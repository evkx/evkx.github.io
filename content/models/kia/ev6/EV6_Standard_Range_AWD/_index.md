## Performance

The Kia EV6 Standard Range AWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 173 kW (235 hp / 232 bhp) and a total torque of 605 Nm (446 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.2 seconds and has a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 58.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 54.0 kWh, providing a 4.0 kWh buffer (6.9%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 523 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 371 km (231 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.6 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 42 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 17 minutes with an average charging speed of 132 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 67%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 109 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 45 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 46 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 5% to 63%, with a total charging time of 87 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 54 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen.

The maximum regenerative power is 150 kW.

## Exterior

The Kia EV6 Standard Range AWD, with dimensions of 4680 mm in length, 1880 mm in width, and 1550 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. You can choose between 11 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The Kia EV6 Standard Range AWD offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
