## Performance

The Kia EV6 Long Range AWD (GEN1) delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 239 kW (325 hp / 321 bhp) and a total torque of 605 Nm (446 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.2 seconds and reaches a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 77.4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74.0 kWh, providing a 3.4 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 697 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 506 to 484 km (315-301 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.3 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 39 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 17 minutes with an average charging speed of 188 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 149 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 20 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Kia EV6 Long Range AWD (GEN1) a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 24 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 27 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 1% to 76%, totaling 67 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 6 hours and 43 minutes using a home setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/kia/ev6/ev6_long_range_awd_gen1/charging_1_st.jpg" title="Kia EV6 Long Range AWD (GEN1)" width="3000" height="2000"  >}}

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.6 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.
