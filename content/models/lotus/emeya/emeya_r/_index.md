## Performance

The Lotus Emeya R delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 675 KW (918 hp/905 bhp) and a massive total torque of 985 Nm (727 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.78 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 256 km/h (159 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 102 kWh and a net usable capacity of 100 kWh, providing a 2 kWh buffer (2.0%) for battery protection.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 535 to 490 km (333-305 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 18.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 20.4 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 400 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 41 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 14 minutes with an average charging speed at 305 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 72%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 232 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 53 seconds. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Lotus Emeya R one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 27 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 4 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 4% to 61%, with a total charging time of 45 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 4 hours and 32 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Lotus Emeya R features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension and rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 162 mm, and the maximum is 212 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Lotus Emeya R. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs are 412mm, and the rear discs are 397mm. The second option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs are 412mm, and the rear discs are 397mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Lotus Emeya R, with dimensions of 5139 mm in length, 2005 mm in width, and 1464 mm in height, falls into F-segment cars, also known as luxury or full-size luxury cars, represent the pinnacle of automotive luxury, performance, and technology. They are typically large sedans or limousines and are designed to offer the utmost in comfort, prestige, and advanced features. The Lotus Emeya R is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including several striking metallic options. Some of these paint options include two-tone paints where the roof and upper part of the body are painted in a different color, providing a distinctive and stylish look.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Lotus Emeya R, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/40 tires on 21" rims front and 305/35 tires on 21" rims rear
- 265/35 tires on 22" rims front and 305/30 tires on 22" rims rear

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass in multiple levels to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
