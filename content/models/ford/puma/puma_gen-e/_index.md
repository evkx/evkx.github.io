We've organized this article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. Additionally, we offer an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections include:

## Performance

The Ford Puma Gen-E offers modest performance with a maximum power of 123.5 kW (168 hp / 166 bhp) and a total torque of 290 Nm (214 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 46.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 43.6 kWh, providing a 2.4 kWh buffer (5.2%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 376 to 347 km (234-216 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 11.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 12.6 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 62 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed of 75 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 67%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 65 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 10 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 11 hours and 14 minutes, requiring seven charging stops from 6% to 68%, totaling 175 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 3 hours and 57 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. This model uses the [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) connector for the chargeport.

## Drivetrain

The Ford Puma Gen-E has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 129 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Ford Puma Gen-E, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The Ford Puma Gen-E lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 4 modes:

- Normal: Balanced steering and throttle.
- Eco: Balanced steering and efficent throttle.
- Sport: Dynamic steering and throttle.
- Slippery: Balanced steering and throttle.

### Brakes

The Ford Puma Gen-E is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

If you lift away the foot completely the regen is at one fixed level. This can't be adjusted.

## Exterior

The Ford Puma Gen-E, with dimensions of 4214 mm in length, 1805 mm in width, and  mm in height, falls into the B-SUV segment cars, also known as subcompact SUVs or crossovers, offer a combination of the compact size and maneuverability of B-segment cars with the higher driving position, increased cargo space, and rugged styling of an SUV. The Ford Puma Gen-E is available in a total of 6 solid paint colors.

The Ford Puma Gen-E offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 215/55 tires on 17" rims
- 215/50 tires on 18" rims
- 225/40 tires on 19" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [boot lid](../../../../technology/doors/#boot-lid) for the trunk.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an manual curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
