We've organized this article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. Additionally, we offer an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections include:

## Performance

The Ford Puma Gen-E offers modest performance with a maximum power of 123.5 kW (168 hp / 166 bhp) and a total torque of 290 Nm (214 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 43.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 40.0 kWh, providing a 3.0 kWh buffer (7.0%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 376 km (234 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 10.6 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 57 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 22 minutes with an average charging speed of 77 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 67%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 65 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 11 seconds.

### Onboard Charger

### Charge Port

Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

If you lift away the foot completely the regen is at one fixed level. This can't be adjusted.

## Exterior
