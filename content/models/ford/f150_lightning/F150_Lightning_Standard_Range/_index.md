## Performance

The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range has a maximum power of 433 KW (589 hp/581 bhp) and a total torque of 1050 nm (775 ft-lb). It can sprint from 0 to 100km/h (0 to 62mph) in 4.2 seconds and has a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph).

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 110kWh and a net capacity of 98kWh, meaning you have a 12kWh buffer for protection. (10.9%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) is 427 km (265 mi). The consumption is 23.0kWh/100km for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The maximum DC charging speed is 155kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 97 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 37 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 0% to 72%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss, of 103kW. Each charge session would take 41 minutes and 14 seconds.

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 33kWh/100km, 1000km will take 10 hours and 35 minutes. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 0% to 79%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 136 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the  onboard charger supports up to 19.2 KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 5 hours and 6 minutes.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle.

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 226 mm.

### Brakes



[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. Hold mode stops the car completely using friction brakes, and roll mode causes the vehicle to roll until it stops by itself.

## Exterior

You can choose between 6 different paint colors when ordering this model.
Additionally, you can choose between 3 wheels with sizes from 18 to 22 inches.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down.

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range has several standard and optional [advanced driver assistance systems](../../../../technology/driverassistance/)  (ADAS) for better safety and comfort.
### Safety systems



The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range has an [**anti-lock braking system (ABS)**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/antilockbrakingsystem/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent a vehicle's wheels from locking up during braking.

The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range has a [**lane-keeping assist**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanekeepingassist/)  as a standard system. This system helps to prevent the car from getting out of its lane. In addition, it has a [**lane departure warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/lanedeparturewarning/) system that warns the driver if the vehicle leaves the driving lane.

[**Forward Collision Warning**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/forwardcollisionwarning/) is a standard driver assist system to help drivers avoid or mitigate frontal collisions.

The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range has [**automatic emergency braking**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencybraking/) as a standard system. This system helps prevent or mitigate collisions by applying the brakes autonomously if the driver fails to react to an impending collision.

[**Automatic emergency steering**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/automaticemergencysteering/) is an optional  driver assist system designed to help drivers avoid collisions by automatically steering the vehicle in an emergency.

[**Blind-spot monitoring**](../../../../technology/driverassistance/blindspotmonitoring/) is an optional driver-assist system. This side assist system helps to detect traffic in blind spots.

### Driving Automation

The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range offers [driving automation on level 1 or 2](../../../../technology/driverassistance/#level-of-autonomous-driving), depending on the equipment level.
