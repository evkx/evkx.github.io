## Performance

The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 433 kW (589 hp / 581 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1050 Nm (775 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.2 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it a standout in its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 110.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 98.0 kWh, providing a 12.0 kWh buffer (10.9%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 427 km (265 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 23.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 155 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 99 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 38 minutes with an average charging speed of 110 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 71%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 101 kW, with each charging session taking about 41 minutes and 26 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 33 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 38 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 0% to 79%, totaling 138 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 19.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 6 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Ford F150 Lightning Standard Range features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 226 mm.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.
