## Performance

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 433 kW (589 hp / 581 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1050 Nm (775 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.2 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 150 kWh and a net usable capacity of 130 kWh, providing a 20 kWh buffer (13.3%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 320 to 300 miles (515-483 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 2.5 mi/kWh for the base model and 2.3 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 155 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 129 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 49 minutes with an average charging speed at 112 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 62%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 106 kW, with each charging session taking about 46 minutes and 35 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 33 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 13 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 0% to 77%, with a total charging time of 114 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 19.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 46 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 226 mm.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

## Exterior

The Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Ford F150 Lightning Extended Range, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/70 tires on 18" rims
- 275/60 tires on 20" rims
- 285/45 tires on 22" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down.

There is only one roof option for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.
