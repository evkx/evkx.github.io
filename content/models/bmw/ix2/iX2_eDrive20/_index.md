## Performance

The BMW iX2 eDrive20 offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 247 Nm (182 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.6 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 68.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 64.7 kWh, providing a 3.3 kWh buffer (4.9%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 286 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 449 to 417 km (279-259 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.4 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 130 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 63 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed of 81 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 50%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 83 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 50 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 14 minutes, requiring five charging stops from 1% to 50%, totaling 114 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 52 minutes using a home setup. An optional 22 kW onboard charger reduces the full charge time to approximately 2 hours and 56 minutes.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The BMW iX2 eDrive20 has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle. The motor used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/).

### Suspension

The Adaptive M Suspension suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 170 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the BMW iX2 eDrive20, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

The maximum regenerative power is 134 kW.

## Exterior

The BMW iX2 eDrive20, with dimensions of 4554 mm in length, 1845 mm in width, and 1560 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. You can choose between 12 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The BMW iX2 eDrive20 offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 205/65 tires on 17" rims
- 255/60 tires on 18" rims
- 205/55 tires on 19" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
