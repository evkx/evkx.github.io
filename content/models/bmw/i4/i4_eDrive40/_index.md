## Performance

The BMW i4 eDrive40 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 250 kW (340 hp / 335 bhp) and a total torque of 430 Nm (317 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 190 km/h (118 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 83.9 kWh and a net usable capacity of 80.7 kWh, providing a 3.2 kWh buffer (3.8%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 399 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 590 to 493 km (367-306 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.4 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 56 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed of 116 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 50%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 118 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 20 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 18 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 11 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 3% to 45%, with a total charging time of 52 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 20 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The BMW i4 eDrive40 has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/).

### Suspension

The Standard suspension has air suspension on the rear axle that automaticly keep the car leveled depending on cargo weight. The ground clearance with this suspension is 125 mm. The  suspension has adaptive damping on the front and rear axle and air suspension on the rear axle that automatically keeps the car leveled depending on cargo weight. The ground clearance with this suspension is 125 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the BMW i4 eDrive40, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

The maximum regenerative power is 116 kW.

## Exterior

The BMW i4 eDrive40, with dimensions of 4783 mm in length, 1852 mm in width, and 1448 mm in height, falls into D-segment cars, also known as mid-size or family cars, offer more space, comfort, and features than smaller segments, making them suitable for a variety of drivers. The BMW i4 eDrive40 is available in a total of 11 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

The BMW i4 eDrive40 offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 245/45 tires on 18" rims front and 255/45 tires on 18" rims rear
- 245/40 tires on 19" rims front and 255/40 tires on 19" rims rear
- 245/35 tires on 20" rims front and 255/35 tires on 20" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate), which makes the trunk much more usable compared to a traditional bootlid, especially for a sedan. Soft close is an optional function for the side doors. The tailgate is electrically powered.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a sunroof. The glass extends over only the front row, and occupants can open it. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
