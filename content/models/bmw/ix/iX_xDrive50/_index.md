## Performance

The BMW iX xDrive50 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 385 kW (524 hp / 516 bhp) and a total torque of 765 Nm (565 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 111.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 105.2 kWh, providing a 5.8 kWh buffer (5.2%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 369 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 631 to 550 km (392-342 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 19.1 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 59 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed of 138 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 53%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 132 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 49 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 25 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 4% to 50%, with a total charging time of 66 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 9 hours and 33 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The BMW iX xDrive50 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Wound-Rotor Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/wrsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 193 mm, and the maximum is 223 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the BMW iX xDrive50, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

## Exterior

The BMW iX xDrive50, with dimensions of 4953 mm in length, 1967 mm in width, and 1696 mm in height, falls into the Mid-size SUVs offer a blend of space, comfort, performance, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of drivers with diverse needs. You can choose between 9 different paint colors when ordering this model.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the BMW iX xDrive50, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 22" rims front and 275/40 tires on 22" rims rear

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close is an optional function for the side doors. The electric-powered liftgate has a kick-sensor as optional equipment, making it possible to open it by just kicking the foot under the tailgate.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
