## Performance

The Subaru Solterra AWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 160 kW (218 hp / 215 bhp) and a total torque of 337 Nm (249 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.9 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 71.4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 64.0 kWh, providing a 7.4 kWh buffer (10.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 355.2 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 466 to 416 km (290-259 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 13.7 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.4 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 147 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 84 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 38 minutes with an average charging speed of 70 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 48%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 78 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 33 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 28 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 1% to 53%, with a total charging time of 128 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Subaru Solterra AWD features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 177 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Subaru Solterra AWD, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The Subaru Solterra AWD lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 3 modes:

- Normal: Balanced steering and throttle. - X-Mode: Dynamic steering and throttle. - Eco: Balanced steering and efficent throttle.

### Brakes

The Subaru Solterra AWD is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 328 mm, while the rear discs are 317 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are four levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 100 kW.

## Exterior

The Subaru Solterra AWD, with dimensions of 4690 mm in length, 1860 mm in width, and 1600 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. You can choose between 1 different paint colors when ordering this model.

The Subaru Solterra AWD offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/60 tires on 18" rims
- 235/50 tires on 20" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
