## Performance

The Xiaomi SU7 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 220 kW (299 hp / 295 bhp) and a total torque of 400 Nm (295 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.28 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 73.6 kWh and a net usable capacity of 73.0 kWh, providing a 0.6 kWh buffer (0.8%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 700 km (435 miles). The energy consumption is 10.4 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 46 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 25 minutes with an average charging speed of 122 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 72%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 106 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 31 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 16 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 9 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 3% to 63%, with a total charging time of 50 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 38 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
