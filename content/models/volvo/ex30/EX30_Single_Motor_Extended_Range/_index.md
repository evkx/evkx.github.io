## Performance

The Volvo EX30 Single Motor Extended Range offers modest performance with a maximum power of 200 kW (272 hp / 268 bhp) and a total torque of 343 Nm (253 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.3 seconds and has a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 69.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 64.0 kWh, providing a 5.0 kWh buffer (7.2%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 460 km (286 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 153 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 73 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 30 minutes with an average charging speed of 91 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 11% to 52%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 90 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 25 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 220 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 8 hours and 5 minutes, requiring 88 charging stops from 11% to 49%, totaling 1425 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 49 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
