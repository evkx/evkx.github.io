## Performance

The Volvo EX30 Single Motor Extended Range offers modest performance with a maximum power of 200 kW (272 hp / 268 bhp) and a total torque of 343 Nm (253 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.3 seconds and has a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 69 kWh and a net usable capacity of 64 kWh, providing an 5 kWh buffer (7.2%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 460 km (286 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 153 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 71 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed at 93 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 11% to 52%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 92 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 10 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 220 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 7 hours and 44 minutes. This journey would require 88 charging stops from 11% to 49%, with a total charging time of 1405 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
