## Performance

The Fisker Ocean Extreme delivers impressive performance with a maximum power of 415 kW (564 hp / 557 bhp) when using overboost. Without overboost, it still offers a robust 344 kW (468 hp / 461 bhp). The vehicle generates a maximum torque of 737 Nm (544 lb-ft), enabling it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4 seconds and reach a top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph).

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 113.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 106.5 kWh, providing a 6.5 kWh buffer (5.8%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 380 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 707 to 701 km (439-436 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 15.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 15.2 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 170 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 79 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 39 minutes with an average charging speed of 114 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 46%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 113 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 47 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 29 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 58 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 2% to 60%, with a total charging time of 98 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 9 hours and 40 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Fisker Ocean Extreme features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The standard suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 165 mm.

### Drive Modes

The Fisker Ocean Extreme lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 4 modes:

- Earth: Balanced steering, with efficient throttle, and strong lift-up regen.
- Fun: Balanced steering and throttle, and medium lift-up regen.
- Hyper: Balanced steering, dynamic throttle, and medium lift-up regen.
- Snow/Ice: Balanced steering, with efficient throttle, and low lift-up regen.

### Brakes

The Fisker Ocean Extreme is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Fisker Ocean Extreme, with dimensions of 4774 mm in length, 1982 mm in width, and 1631 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The Fisker Ocean Extreme is available in a total of 12 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

The Fisker Ocean Extreme offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 20" rims
- 255/45 tires on 22" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.
