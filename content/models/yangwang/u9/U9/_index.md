## Performance

The YangWang U9 delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 960 KW (1305 hp/1287 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1680 Nm (1240 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.36 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 309 km/h (192 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 83.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 80.0 kWh, providing a 3.0 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 630 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 465 km (289 miles). The energy consumption is 17.2 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 500 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 45 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 23 minutes with an average charging speed of 145 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 69%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 128 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 31 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 26 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 45 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 1% to 76%, totaling 86 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 22 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 3 hours and 38 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The YangWang U9 has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 120 mm, and the maximum is 120 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the YangWang U9, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The YangWang U9 lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 5 modes:

- Range: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Cruise: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Sport: Balanced steering, lowest suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Track: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Drift: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs measure 390 mm, while the rear discs are 390 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 400 kW.
