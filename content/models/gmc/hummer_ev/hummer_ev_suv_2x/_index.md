## Performance

The GMC Hummer EV SUV 2x packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 425 kW (578 hp / 570 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1150 Nm (849 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.6 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 171 km/h (106 mph), making it a standout in its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 200.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 190.0 kWh, providing a 10.0 kWh buffer (5.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 650 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 30 to 303 miles (48-488 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 0.2 mi/kWh for the base model and 1.6 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 126 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 44 minutes with an average charging speed of 182 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 62%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 235 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 33 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the GMC Hummer EV SUV 2x a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 43 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 22 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 0% to 64%, totaling 62 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 19.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 9 hours and 53 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 6 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.

- Normal: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Comfort: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Terrain: Balanced steering, high suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Off-Road: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Tow/Haul: Balanced steering, adaptive suspension height with balanced throttle, and adaptive suspension damping.
- My Mode: User-defined settings for steering, suspension, and throttle response.

### Brakes

The GMC Hummer EV SUV 2x is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 343 mm, while the rear discs are 343 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

If you lift away the foot completely the regen is at one fixed level. This can't be adjusted.

The maximum regenerative power is 400 kW.
