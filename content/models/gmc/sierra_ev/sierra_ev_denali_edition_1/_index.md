## Performance

The GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 562 kW (764 hp / 754 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1064 Nm (785 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), making it a standout in its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 225.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 215.0 kWh, providing a 10.0 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 355 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 440 miles (708 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.0 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 143 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 50 minutes with an average charging speed of 182 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 48%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 241 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 10 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 38 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 2 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 1% to 40%, totaling 42 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 19.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 11 hours and 11 minutes using a home setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/gmc/sierra_ev/sierra_ev_denali_edition_1/charging_1_st.jpg" title="GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1" width="1920" height="960"  >}}

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports both V2L (Vehicle to Load) and V2H (Vehicle to Home) functionalities. V2L allows you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 10.2 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles. V2H enables the car to serve as a backup power source for your home. Sockets are available in the cargo bed, the frunk, and the cabin. Note that V2H requires specialized equipment in your home.

- Normal: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Off-Road: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Tow/Haul: Balanced steering, adaptive suspension height with balanced throttle, and adaptive suspension damping.
- My Mode: User-defined settings for steering, suspension, and throttle response.

### Brakes

The GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 368 mm, while the rear discs are 345 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes and **Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 400 kW.
