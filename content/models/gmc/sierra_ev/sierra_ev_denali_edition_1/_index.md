## Performance

The GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 562 kW (764 hp / 754 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1064 Nm (785 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 240.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 215.0 kWh, providing a 25.0 kWh buffer (10.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 440 miles (708 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.0 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 350 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 140 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 49 minutes with an average charging speed of 186 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 52%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 245 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 51 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1 a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 38 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 1 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 40%, with a total charging time of 42 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 19.2 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 11 hours and 11 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/gmc/sierra_ev/sierra_ev_denali_edition_1/charging_1_st.jpg" title="GMC Sierra EV Denali Edition 1" width="1920" height="960"  >}}

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports both V2L (Vehicle to Load) and V2H (Vehicle to Home) functionalities. V2L allows you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 10.2 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles. V2H enables the car to serve as a backup power source for your home. Sockets are available in the cargo bed, the frunk, and the cabin. Note that V2H requires specialized equipment in your home.
