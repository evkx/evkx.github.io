## Performance

The BYD Han delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 380 kW (517 hp / 510 bhp) and a total torque of 700 Nm (517 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 85.4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 83.0 kWh, providing a 2.4 kWh buffer (2.8%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 569 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 521 km (324 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 120 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 66 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 36 minutes with an average charging speed of 98 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 91 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 8 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 12 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 8% to 59%, totaling 113 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 7 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 11 hours and 51 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The BYD Han features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the BYD Han, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The BYD Han is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal).

The maximum regenerative power is 200 kW.

## Exterior

The BYD Han, with dimensions of 4995 mm in length, 1910 mm in width, and 1495 mm in height, falls into E-segment cars, also known as executive cars, are larger and more luxurious than their D-segment counterparts. They are designed to offer superior comfort, advanced technology, and high performance, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers. The BYD Han is available in a total of 6 solid paint colors.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the BYD Han, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/40 tires on 22" rims

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate), which makes the trunk much more usable compared to a traditional bootlid, especially for a sedan. The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
