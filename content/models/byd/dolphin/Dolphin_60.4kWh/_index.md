## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 60.4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 62.0 kWh, providing a -1.6 kWh buffer (-2.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 403 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 427 km (265 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.5 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 88 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 73 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 42 minutes with an average charging speed of 61 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 59 kW, with each charging session taking about 26 minutes and 26 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 11 hours and 2 minutes, requiring six charging stops from 0% to 43%, totaling 163 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 38 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
