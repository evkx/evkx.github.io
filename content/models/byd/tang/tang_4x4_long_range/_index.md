## Performance

The BYD Tang 4x4 Long Range delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 380 kW (517 hp / 510 bhp) and a total torque of 680 Nm (502 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 190 km/h (118 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 108.8 kWh and a net usable capacity of 107.0 kWh, providing a 1.8 kWh buffer (1.7%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 640 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 530 km (329 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 20.2 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 170 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 85 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 46 minutes with an average charging speed of 98 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 94 kW, with each charging session taking about 37 minutes and 24 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 31.7 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 37 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 9% to 59%, with a total charging time of 137 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 9 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 4 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 320 mm, while the rear discs are 320 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

The maximum regenerative power is 200 kW.

## Exterior

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
