## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 38.8 kWh and a net usable capacity of 37.0 kWh, providing a 1.8 kWh buffer (4.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 403 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 405 km (252 miles). The energy consumption is 9.1 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 40 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 86 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 43 minutes with an average charging speed of 36 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 13% to 75%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 33 kW, with each charging session taking about 42 minutes and 16 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 19 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 13 hours and 4 minutes, requiring six charging stops from 10% to 79%, totaling 284 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 6.6 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 36 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
