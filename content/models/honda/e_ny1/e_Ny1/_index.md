<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 68.8 kWh and a net usable capacity of 61.9 kWh, providing a 6.9 kWh buffer (10.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 370 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 412 km (256 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 78 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 125 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 44 minutes with an average charging speed of 59 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 55%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 56 kW, with each charging session taking about 34 minutes and 48 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 24.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 11 hours and 38 minutes, requiring six charging stops from 5% to 55%, totaling 199 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 5 hours and 37 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [front](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. This model uses the [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) connector for the chargeport.
