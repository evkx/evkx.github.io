## Performance

The Honda Prologue AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 214 kW (291 hp / 287 bhp) and a total torque of 451 Nm (333 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 89.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 85.0 kWh, providing a 4.0 kWh buffer (4.5%) for battery protection.

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 281 to 273 miles (452-439 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 3.3 mi/kWh for the base model and 3.2 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 66 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed of 113 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 56%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 102 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 56 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 57 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 6% to 55%, with a total charging time of 98 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 23 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
