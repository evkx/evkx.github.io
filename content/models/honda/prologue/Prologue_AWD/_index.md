## Performance

The Honda Prologue AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 214 kW (291 hp / 287 bhp) and a total torque of 451 Nm (333 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 93.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 91.0 kWh, providing a 2.0 kWh buffer (2.2%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 296 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 281 to 273 miles (452-439 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 3.1 mi/kWh for the base model and 3.0 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 87 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 35 minutes with an average charging speed of 110 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 58%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 107 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 5 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 50 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 1% to 60%, totaling 90 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 54 minutes using a home setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/honda/prologue/prologue_awd/charging_1_st.jpg" title="Honda Prologue AWD" width="3000" height="2250"  >}}

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 1800 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.
