We've organized this article into specific sections for easier navigation. Click the links below to jump to different areas or read on for the full article. Additionally, we offer an overview of the [full specifications](specifications/), an [image gallery](gallery/), detailed information about [charging performance](chargingcurve/), and some [online reviews](reviews/). Our sections include:

## Performance

The Honda Prologue AWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 214 kW (291 hp / 287 bhp) and a total torque of 451 Nm (333 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 89.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 85.0 kWh, providing a 4.0 kWh buffer (4.5%) for battery protection.

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 281 to 273 miles (452-439 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 3.3 mi/kWh for the base model and 3.2 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 68 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed of 111 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 56%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 101 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 21 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 59 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 6% to 55%, with a total charging time of 99 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 23 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
