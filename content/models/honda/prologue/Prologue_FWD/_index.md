## Performance

The Honda Prologue FWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 158 kW (215 hp / 212 bhp) and a total torque of 320 Nm (236 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.5 seconds and has a top speed of 182 km/h (113 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 89.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 85.0 kWh, providing a 4.0 kWh buffer (4.5%) for battery protection.

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 296 miles (476 km) with an energy consumption rate of 3.5 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 68 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed of 111 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 56%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 101 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 21 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 59 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 6% to 55%, totaling 99 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 23 minutes using a home setup.
