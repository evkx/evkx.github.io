## Performance

The Genesis GV60 2WD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 168 kW (228 hp / 225 bhp) and a total torque of 350 Nm (258 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.5 seconds and has a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 77,4 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74 kWh, providing a 3,4 kWh buffer (4.4%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 697 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 517 km (321 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.3 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 233 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 38 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed at 192 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 152 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 59 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Genesis GV60 2WD a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 25 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 1% to 76%, with a total charging time of 66 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Genesis GV60 2WD has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 161 mm.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen.

The maximum regenerative power is 150 kW.

## Exterior

The Genesis GV60 2WD, with dimensions of 4515 mm in length, 1890 mm in width, and 1580 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The Genesis GV60 2WD is available in a total of 10 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Genesis GV60 2WD, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims
- 255/45 tires on 20" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
