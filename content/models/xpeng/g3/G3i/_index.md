## Performance

The XPENG G3i offers modest performance with a maximum power of 145 kW (197 hp / 194 bhp) and a total torque of 300 Nm (221 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 8.6 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 66.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 55.9 kWh, providing a 10.1 kWh buffer (15.3%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 420 km (261 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.3 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 50 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 91 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 52 minutes with an average charging speed of 45 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 8% to 79%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 41 kW, with each charging session taking about 58 minutes and 50 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 13 hours and 5 minutes, requiring five charging stops from 9% to 79%, totaling 285 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 6.6 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 28 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
