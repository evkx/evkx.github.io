## Performance

The XPENG X9 AWD Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 370 kW (503 hp / 496 bhp) and a total torque of 640 Nm (472 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 101.5 kWh and a net usable capacity of 98.0 kWh, providing a 3.5 kWh buffer (3.4%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 640 km (398 miles). The energy consumption is 15.3 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 53 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 20 minutes with an average charging speed of 202 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 60%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 169 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 29 seconds. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the XPENG X9 AWD Performance one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 14 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 7% to 59%, totaling 54 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 54 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The XPENG X9 AWD Performance features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 130 mm, and the maximum is 220 mm. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking
