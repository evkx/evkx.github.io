## Performance

The XPENG G6 AWD Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 358 kW (487 hp / 480 bhp) and a total torque of 660 Nm (487 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 92.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 87.5 kWh, providing a 4.5 kWh buffer (4.9%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 550.5 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 550 km (342 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 300 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 50 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 21 minutes with an average charging speed of 175 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 59%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 149 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 37 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the XPENG G6 AWD Performance a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 18 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 6% to 61%, with a total charging time of 58 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 57 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.3 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.

## Drivetrain

The XPENG G6 AWD Performance features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension employs a [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone) design, while the rear uses a [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink) setup. The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 160 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the XPENG G6 AWD Performance, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The XPENG G6 AWD Performance lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 4 modes:

- Comfort: Comfort steering and efficent throttle. - Standard: Balanced steering and throttle. - Sport: Dynamic steering and throttle. - Individual: User-defined settings for steering and throttle.

### Brakes

The XPENG G6 AWD Performance is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes, and **Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The XPENG G6 AWD Performance, with dimensions of 4753 mm in length, 1920 mm in width, and 1650 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The XPENG G6 AWD Performance is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the XPENG G6 AWD Performance, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [hatchback-style liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#hatcback-style-liftgate).

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending over most areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
