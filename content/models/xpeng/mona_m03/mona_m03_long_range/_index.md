## Performance

The XPENG Mona M03 Long Range delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 210 kW (286 hp / 282 bhp) and a total torque of 440 Nm (325 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.4 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 62.2 kWh and a net usable capacity of 61.0 kWh, providing a 1.2 kWh buffer (1.9%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 473 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 618 km (384 miles). The energy consumption is 9.9 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 92 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 99 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 42 minutes with an average charging speed of 61 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 55%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 61 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 31 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 59 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 7% to 51%, with a total charging time of 159 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 5 hours and 32 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.3 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.
