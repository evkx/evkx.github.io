## Performance

The XPENG P7 AWD Performance packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 405 kW (551 hp / 543 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 717 Nm (529 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 205 km/h (127 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 86.2 kWh and a net usable capacity of 82.7 kWh, providing a 3.5 kWh buffer (4.1%) for battery protection. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 505 km (314 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 16.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 175 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 51 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 24 minutes with an average charging speed of 147 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 52%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 146 kW, with each charging session taking about 17 minutes and 16 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 41 minutes, requiring five charging stops from 1% to 49%, totaling 81 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 31 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
