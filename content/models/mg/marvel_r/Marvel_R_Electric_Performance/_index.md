## Performance

The MG Marvel R Electric Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 212 kW (288 hp / 284 bhp) and a total torque of 665 Nm (491 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 75 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70 kWh, providing a 5 kWh buffer (6.7%) for battery protection.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 370 km (230 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 18.9 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 94 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 114 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 43 minutes with an average charging speed at 69 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 8% to 61%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 63 kW, with each charging session taking about 35 minutes and 7 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 24.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 6 minutes. This journey would require five charging stops from 9% to 59%, with a total charging time of 166 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 21 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The MG Marvel R Electric Performance has an all-wheel drive system supported by three motors. One on front axle, and two on rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 150 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

## Exterior

The MG Marvel R Electric Performance, with dimensions of 4674 mm in length, 1919 mm in width, and 1618 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The MG Marvel R Electric Performance is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
