## Performance

The MG MG4 Electric Standard offers modest performance with a maximum power of 125 kW (170 hp / 168 bhp) and a total torque of 250 Nm (184 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.9 seconds and has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 51.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 50.8 kWh, providing a 0.2 kWh buffer (0.4%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 350 km (218 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 14.5 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 87 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 83 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 36 minutes with an average charging speed of 59 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 60%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 59 kW, with each charging session taking about 29 minutes and 18 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 11 hours and 3 minutes, requiring six charging stops from 3% to 56%, totaling 164 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 6.6 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 41 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger.

<a id="section-drivetrain" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Drivetrain

The MG MG4 Electric Standard has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 150 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the MG MG4 Electric Standard, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The MG MG4 Electric Standard is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are four levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.
