## Performance

The Leapmotor C10 69kWh RWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 170 kW (231 hp / 228 bhp) and a total torque of 320 Nm (236 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.29 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 69.9 kWh and a net usable capacity of 67.0 kWh, providing a 2.9 kWh buffer (4.1%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 420 km (261 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 16.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 80 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 109 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed of 69 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 16% to 80%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 63 kW, with each charging session taking about 41 minutes and 50 seconds.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 6.7 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 0 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.3 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 180 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Leapmotor C10 69kWh RWD, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

## Exterior
