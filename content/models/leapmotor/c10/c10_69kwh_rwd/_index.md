## Performance

The Leapmotor C10 69kWh RWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 170 kW (231 hp / 228 bhp) and a total torque of 320 Nm (236 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.29 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 69.9 kWh and a net usable capacity of 67.0 kWh, providing a 2.9 kWh buffer (4.1%) for battery protection. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 420 km (261 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 16.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 80 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 109 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed of 69 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 16% to 80%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 63 kW, with each charging session taking about 41 minutes and 50 seconds.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 6.7 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 10 hours and 0 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 3.3 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 180 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Leapmotor C10 69kWh RWD, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Leapmotor C10 69kWh RWD is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

## Exterior

The Leapmotor C10 69kWh RWD, with dimensions of 4739 mm in length, 1900 mm in width, and 1680 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs.
