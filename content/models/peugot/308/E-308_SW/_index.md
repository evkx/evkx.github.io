## Performance

The Peugot E-308 SW offers modest performance with a maximum power of 115 kW (156 hp / 154 bhp) and a total torque of 260 Nm (192 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 10.5 seconds and has a top speed of 170 km/h (106 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 54.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 50.8 kWh, providing a 3.2 kWh buffer (5.9%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 377 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 410 km (255 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 12.4 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 58 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed of 72 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 57%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 65 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 50 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 11 hours and 27 minutes, requiring seven charging stops from 3% to 60%, totaling 188 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 4 hours and 37 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Peugot E-308 SW has a front-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the front axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Torsion Beam](../../../../technology/suspension/#torsion-beam). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has a fixed height and damping. The ground clearance with this suspension is 140 mm.

### Brakes

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

## Exterior

The Peugot E-308 SW, with dimensions of 4636 mm in length, 1859 mm in width, and 1442 mm in height, falls into D-segment cars, also known as mid-size or family cars, offer more space, comfort, and features than smaller segments, making them suitable for a variety of drivers. The Peugot E-308 SW is available in a total of 6 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the Peugot E-308 SW, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 215/45 tires on 18" rims front and 215/45 tires on 18" rims rear

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
