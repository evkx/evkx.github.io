## Performance

The Onvo L60 RWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 240 kW (326 hp / 322 bhp) and a total torque of 305 Nm (225 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.9 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

Onvo L60 RWD has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging.

### 85kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 85.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 90.0 kWh, providing a -5.0 kWh buffer (-5.9%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 792 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 730 km (454 miles). The energy consumption is 12.3 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 38 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 21 minutes with an average charging speed of 183 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 77%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 153 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 44 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Onvo L60 RWD a convenient option for long-distance travel.

### 60kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 60.6 kWh and a net usable capacity of 59.0 kWh, providing a 1.6 kWh buffer (2.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 685 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 555 km (345 miles). The energy consumption is 12.3 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 150 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 48 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 25 minutes with an average charging speed of 99 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 6% to 76%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 83 kW, with each charging session taking about 30 minutes and 53 seconds.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 10 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger.
