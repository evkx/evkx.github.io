## Performance

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD MP delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 764 KW (1039 hp/1025 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1623 Nm (1198 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 2.6 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 149.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 141.5 kWh, providing a 7.5 kWh buffer (5.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 392 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 321 to 340 miles (516-547 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 2.3 mi/kWh for the base model and 2.4 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 220 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 127 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 46 minutes with an average charging speed of 130 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 141 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 5 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 29 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 0% to 38%, with a total charging time of 69 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 12 hours and 18 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD MP has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 205 mm, and the maximum is 365 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD MP, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Drive Modes

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD MP lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 5 modes:

- Sport: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Snow: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- All-Purpose: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Soft sand: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and comfort suspension damping.
- All-Terrain: Balanced steering, high suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 343 mm, while the rear discs are 328 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD MP, with dimensions of 5100 mm in length,  mm in width, and 1966 mm in height, falls into the Full-size SUVs offer the most space, power, and capability among SUV categories, making them suitable for a specific set of drivers with unique needs The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD MP is available in a total of 9 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

- 275/50 tires on 22" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [split tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the bottom part falls and the top part lifts.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass in multiple levels to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
