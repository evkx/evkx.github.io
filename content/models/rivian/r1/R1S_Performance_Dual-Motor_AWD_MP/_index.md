## Performance

The Rivian R1S Performance Dual-Motor AWD MP packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 489 kW (665 hp / 656 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1123 Nm (829 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.6 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 149 kWh and a net usable capacity of 142,3 kWh, providing an 6,7 kWh buffer (4.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 392 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 410 miles (660 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.9 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 119 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 48 minutes with an average charging speed at 125 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 141 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 12 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 28 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 0% to 37%, with a total charging time of 68 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 12 hours and 22 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
