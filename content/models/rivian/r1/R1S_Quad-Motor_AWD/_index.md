## Performance

The Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 620 KW (843 hp/831 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1231 Nm (908 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.1 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 135.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 125.0 kWh, providing a 10.0 kWh buffer (7.4%) for battery protection.

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 321 to 289 miles (516-465 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 2.6 mi/kWh for the base model and 2.3 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 106 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 43 minutes with an average charging speed of 123 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 135 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 55 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 38 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 0% to 47%, totaling 78 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 10 hours and 52 minutes using a home setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/rivian/r1/r1s_quad-motor_awd/charging_1_st.jpg" title="Rivian R1S Quad-Motor AWD" width="2880" height="1920"  >}}

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
