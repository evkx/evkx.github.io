## Performance

The Rivian R1T Performance Dual-Motor AWD MP packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 495 kW (673 hp / 664 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1124 Nm (830 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 149 kWh and a net usable capacity of 143 kWh, providing a 6 kWh buffer (4.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 392 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 410 miles (660 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.9 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 129 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 46 minutes with an average charging speed at 130 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 141 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 19 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 28 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 0% to 37%, with a total charging time of 68 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 12 hours and 26 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Rivian R1T Performance Dual-Motor AWD MP features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 205 mm, and the maximum is 378 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 343mm, and the rear discs are 328mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Rivian R1T Performance Dual-Motor AWD MP is available in a total of 9 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down. The tailgate is electrically powered.

There is only one roof option for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
