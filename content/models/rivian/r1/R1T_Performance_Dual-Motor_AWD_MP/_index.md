## Performance

The Rivian R1T Performance Dual-Motor AWD MP packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 495 kW (673 hp / 664 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 1124 Nm (830 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.5 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 149.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 143.0 kWh, providing a 6.0 kWh buffer (4.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 392 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) standard, the vehicle has an range of 410 miles (660 km) with an energy consumption rate of 2.9 miles per kWh. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this modelâ€™s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 131 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 47 minutes with an average charging speed of 127 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 139 kW, with each charging session taking about 28 minutes and 47 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 29 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 0% to 37%, totaling 69 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 12 hours and 26 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
