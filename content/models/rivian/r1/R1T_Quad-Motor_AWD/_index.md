## Performance

The Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 620 KW (843 hp/831 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1231 Nm (908 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.1 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 201 km/h (125 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 135 kWh and a net usable capacity of 125 kWh, providing an 10 kWh buffer (7.4%) for battery protection.

The [EPA](../../../../guides/understandingrange/epa/) (Environmental Protection Agency) estimated range varies between 321 to 289 miles (516-465 km), depending on the vehicle's configuration and options. For instance, larger wheels can increase energy consumption and reduce the overall range.
The energy consumption rates are 2.6 mi/kWh for the base model and 2.3 mi/kWh for the top-tier version, according to the EPA standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of  kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 104 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 42 minutes with an average charging speed at 125 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 45%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 138 kW, with each charging session taking about 25 minutes and 30 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 30 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 36 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 0% to 47%, with a total charging time of 77 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11.5 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 52 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/rivian/r1/r1t_quad-motor_awd/charging_1_st.jpg" title="Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD" width="2048" height="1280"  >}}

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front corner](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-corner). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to park with the front in. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 205 mm, and the maximum is 378 mm.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs are 343mm, and the rear discs are 328mm.

### Regenerative braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. The system stops the car completely using friction brakes.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD is available in a total of 9 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Rivian R1T Quad-Motor AWD, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down. The tailgate is electrically powered.

There is only one roof for this model. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car's interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass is toned to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
