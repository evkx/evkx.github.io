## Performance

The Nio ET9 packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 520 kW (707 hp / 697 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 900 Nm (664 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.8 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 120.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 112.0 kWh, providing a 8.0 kWh buffer (6.7%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 925 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 720 km (448 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 15.6 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 600 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 31 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 14 minutes with an average charging speed of 331 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 5% to 63%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 266 kW, with each charging session taking about 15 minutes and 41 seconds. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Nio ET9 one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 8 hours and 45 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 6% to 55%, with a total charging time of 25 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 10 hours and 10 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes.

## Drivetrain

The Nio ET9 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension and rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 150 mm, and the maximum is 200 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Nio ET9, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Nio ET9, with dimensions of 5325 mm in length, 2016 mm in width, and 1620 mm in height, falls into F-segment cars, also known as luxury or full-size luxury cars, represent the pinnacle of automotive luxury, performance, and technology. They are typically large sedans or limousines and are designed to offer the utmost in comfort, prestige, and advanced features. The Nio ET9 is available in a total of 7 solid paint colors.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the Nio ET9, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 265/40 tires on 23" rims

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate), which makes the trunk much more usable compared to a traditional bootlid, especially for a sedan. Soft close is a standard function for the side doors. The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.
