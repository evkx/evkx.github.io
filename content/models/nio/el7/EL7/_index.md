## Performance

The Nio EL7 packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 480 kW (653 hp / 644 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 850 Nm (627 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.9 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

Nio EL7 has two battery options with different specifications. Below you see how this affects range and charging.

### 100kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100 kWh and a net usable capacity of 90 kWh, providing a 10 kWh buffer (10.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 358 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 513 to 486 km (319-302 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.5 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 126 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 75 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 41 minutes with an average charging speed at 91 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 44%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 86 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 2 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 15 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 1% to 47%, with a total charging time of 116 minutes.

### 75kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 75 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70,5 kWh, providing a 4,5 kWh buffer (6.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 386 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 394 to 372 km (245-231 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.5 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 140 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 65 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 34 minutes with an average charging speed at 87 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 74%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 77 kW, with each charging session taking about 37 minutes and 57 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 25.5 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 45 minutes. This journey would require four charging stops from 7% to 73%, with a total charging time of 146 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 10 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes.

## Drivetrain

The Nio EL7 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 143 mm, and the maximum is 198 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Nio EL7. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The rear and front brakes are [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Nio EL7, with dimensions of 4912 mm in length, 1987 mm in width, and 1720 mm in height, falls into the Mid-size SUVs offer a blend of space, comfort, performance, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of drivers with diverse needs. The Nio EL7 is available in a total of 7 solid paint colors.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Nio EL7, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 20" rims
- 265/45 tires on 21" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close is a standard function for the side doors.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic roof extending from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The trunk offers a cargo capacity of 570 liters (20.1 CU FT). With the rear seat folded down, this expands to 1545 liters (54.6 CU FT). On the roof, you can load up to 100 kg (220.5 lbs). Optional roof rails are available for easy mounting of a roof box or rack.

The vehicle’s maximum weight is 2850 kg (6283 lbs), with a base weight of 2366 kg (5216 lbs). This allows for a maximum load of 484 kg (1067 lbs), including the driver and passengers. Note that some options may increase the base weight and reduce the maximum loading capacity. 484kg is considered low for this type of car and might restrict how much stuff you can bring in addition to passengers.

A towbar can be added to the vehicle. The maximum permissible weight for a braked trailer is 2000 kg (4409 lbs), while for an unbraked trailer, it is 750 kg (1653 lbs).
