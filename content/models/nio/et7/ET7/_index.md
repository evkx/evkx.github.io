## Performance

The Nio ET7 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 360 kW (490 hp / 483 bhp) and a total torque of 700 Nm (517 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 3.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

### 100kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 90.0 kWh, providing a 10.0 kWh buffer (10.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 358 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 580 to 505 km (361-314 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 15.5 kWh/100 km for the base model and 17.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 126 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 77 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 42 minutes with an average charging speed of 89 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 84 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 52 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 54 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 1% to 50%, totaling 94 minutes of charging time.

### 75kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 75.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70.5 kWh, providing a 4.5 kWh buffer (6.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 386 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 445 to 385 km (277-239 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 15.5 kWh/100 km for the base model and 17.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 140 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 66 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 35 minutes with an average charging speed of 85 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 74%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 75 kW, with each charging session taking about 38 minutes and 39 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 25 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 43 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 7% to 71%, totaling 144 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 10 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes.

## Drivetrain

The Nio ET7 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension and rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The  suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 88 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Nio ET7, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Nio ET7 is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Nio ET7, with dimensions of 5101 mm in length, 1987 mm in width, and 1509 mm in height, falls into F-segment cars, also known as luxury or full-size luxury cars, represent the pinnacle of automotive luxury, performance, and technology. They are typically large sedans or limousines and are designed to offer the utmost in comfort, prestige, and advanced features. The Nio ET7 is available in a total of 7 solid paint colors.

The Nio ET7 offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 20" rims
- 255/45 tires on 21" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate), which makes the trunk much more usable compared to a traditional bootlid, especially for a sedan. Soft close is a standard function for the side doors. The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.
