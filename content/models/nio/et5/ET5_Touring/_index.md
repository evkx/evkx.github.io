## Battery, Range, and Charging

The Nio ET5 Touring is available with two battery options, each offering different specifications and performance metrics.

### 100kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 90.0 kWh, providing a 10.0 kWh buffer (10.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 358 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 560 to 540 km (348-336 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.7 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 180 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 77 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 42 minutes with an average charging speed of 89 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 84 kW, with each charging session taking about 27 minutes and 52 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 59 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 1% to 40%, totaling 100 minutes of charging time.

### 75kWh

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 75.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 70.5 kWh, providing a 4.5 kWh buffer (6.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 386 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 456 to 419 km (283-260 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 16.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.7 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 140 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 66 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 35 minutes with an average charging speed of 85 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 7% to 74%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 75 kW, with each charging session taking about 38 minutes and 39 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 29 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 8% to 65%, totaling 129 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 10 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Battery swap

This model support battery swap. Battery swap means you can drive to a unique battery swap station and get the battery replaced with a new battery with 90% SOC. The battery swap takes 7 minutes.

## Drivetrain

The Nio ET5 Touring features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Nio ET5 Touring, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Nio ET5 Touring is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear.

### Regenerative Braking

[**Automatic regeneration**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) is not available in this model. However, [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) combined with [**blended brakes**](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal). At low speeds, the one-pedal drive mode will keep the car creeping forward.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are three levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The Nio ET5 Touring, with dimensions of 4790 mm in length, 1960 mm in width, and 1499 mm in height, falls into D-segment cars, also known as mid-size or family cars, offer more space, comfort, and features than smaller segments, making them suitable for a variety of drivers. The Nio ET5 Touring is available in a total of 10 solid paint colors.

The Nio ET5 Touring offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 255/50 tires on 20" rims
- 255/45 tires on 21" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). Soft close is a standard function for the side doors. The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a large panoramic extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. The glass has an electrochromic function that lets you blend the glass in multiple levels to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
