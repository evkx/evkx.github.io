## Performance

The Polestar 3 Long Range Dual Motor delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 360 kW (490 hp / 483 bhp) and a total torque of 840 Nm (620 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 210 km/h (131 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 111.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 107.0 kWh, providing a 4.0 kWh buffer (3.6%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 370 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc)

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 631 to 584 km (392-363 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 17.0 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.3 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 250 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 68 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 32 minutes with an average charging speed of 140 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 54%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 136 kW, with each charging session taking about 24 minutes and 31 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 9 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 3% to 56%, with a total charging time of 50 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 9 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Polestar 3 Long Range Dual Motor features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle.

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 181 mm, and the maximum is 241 mm.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 400 mm, while the rear discs are 390 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in two modes. You can use [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) or you can coast and use the [blended brakes](../../../../technology/regen/#manual-regen-using-brake-pedal) to regen. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. **Hold mode** brings the vehicle to a complete stop using friction brakes and **Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed.

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

## Cargo Capacity and Towing Ability

The trunk offers a cargo capacity of 484 liters (17.1 CU FT). With the rear seat folded down, this expands to 1411 liters (49.8 CU FT). On the roof, you can load up to 100 kg (220.5 lbs). Additionally, there is a frunk (front trunk) with a storage capacity of 32 liters (1.1 CU FT).

The vehicle’s maximum weight is 3080 kg (6790 lbs), with a base weight of 2600 kg (5732 lbs). This allows for a maximum load of 480 kg (1058 lbs), including the driver and passengers. Note that some options may increase the base weight and reduce the maximum loading capacity. 480kg is considered low for this type of car and might restrict how much stuff you can bring in addition to passengers.

A towbar can be added to the vehicle. The maximum permissible weight for a braked trailer is 2200 kg (4850 lbs), while for an unbraked trailer, it is 750 kg (1653 lbs).
