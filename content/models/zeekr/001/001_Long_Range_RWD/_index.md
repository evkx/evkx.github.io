## Performance

The Zeekr 001 Long Range RWD offers modest performance with a maximum power of 200 kW (272 hp / 268 bhp) and a total torque of 343 Nm (253 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 7.2 seconds and has a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 95.0 kWh, providing a 5.0 kWh buffer (5.0%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 370 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 590 km (367 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 16.1 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 62 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 29 minutes with an average charging speed of 137 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 55%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 131 kW, with each charging session taking about 22 minutes and 14 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 45 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 5% to 54%, totaling 85 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 38 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
