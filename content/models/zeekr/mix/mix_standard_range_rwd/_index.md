## Performance

The Zeekr MIX Standard Range RWD delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 310 kW (422 hp / 416 bhp) and a total torque of 440 Nm (325 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.8 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 76.5 kWh and a net usable capacity of 74.0 kWh, providing a 2.5 kWh buffer (3.3%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 700 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. The Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [LFP technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-iron-phosphate-battery-lfp), offering both benefits and drawbacks compared to typical NCA/NMC batteries.

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 550 km (342 miles). The energy consumption is 13.5 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 450 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 23 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 9 minutes with an average charging speed of 336 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 80%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 227 kW, with each charging session taking about 15 minutes and 14 seconds. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Zeekr MIX Standard Range RWD one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 1 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 3% to 74%, with a total charging time of 42 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 6 hours and 43 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
