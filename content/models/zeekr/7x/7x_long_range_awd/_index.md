## Performance

The Zeekr 7X Long Range AWD packs an impressive punch with a maximum power of 475 kW (646 hp / 637 bhp) and a commanding total torque of 710 Nm (524 lb-ft). This high-performance machine can sprint from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 3.8 seconds, and it reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it a standout in its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 95.0 kWh, providing a 5.0 kWh buffer (5.0%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 700 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

The vehicle's range, according to the [CLTC](../../../../guides/understandingrange/cltc/) (China Light-Duty Vehicle Test Cycle) standard, is 780 km (485 miles). The energy consumption is 12.2 kWh/100 km based on the CLTC standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 59 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 28 minutes with an average charging speed of 144 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 4% to 57%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 132 kW, with each charging session taking about 23 minutes and 51 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 23 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 22 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 6% to 54%, with a total charging time of 62 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 38 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.
