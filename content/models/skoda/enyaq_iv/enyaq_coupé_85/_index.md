## Performance

The SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85 delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 210 kW (286 hp / 282 bhp) and a total torque of 679 Nm (501 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 77.0 kWh, providing a 5.0 kWh buffer (6.1%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 545 to 527 km (339-328 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.6 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 64 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 35 minutes with an average charging speed of 92 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 43%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 100 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 1 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 41 minutes, requiring four charging stops from 2% to 46%, totaling 82 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 0 minutes using a home setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85 features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

The Sport suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 173 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85 uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

## Exterior

The SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85, with dimensions of 4653 mm in length, 1879 mm in width, and 1607 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85 is available in a total of 9 paint colors, including solid, metallic, and pearlescent options.

The SKODA ENYAQ COUPÉ 85 offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/50 tires on 20" rims front and 255/45 tires on 20" rims rear
- 235/45 tires on 21" rims front and 255/40 tires on 21" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof includes a large panoramic glass roof extending from the front to the rear, enhancing the interior's spacious and bright feel, thereby improving the mood and comfort of occupants. This glass is tinted to protect against heat from the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
