## Performance

The MHERO I delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 800 KW (1088 hp/1073 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1400 Nm (1033 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.2 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

<a id="section-battery" style="display: block; position: relative; top: -60px; visibility: hidden;"></a>

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 142.7 kWh and a net usable capacity of 135.0 kWh, providing a 7.7 kWh buffer (5.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 381.68 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 450 km (280 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 30.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 118 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 61 minutes with an average charging speed of 92 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 9% to 82%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 85 kW, with each charging session taking about 69 minutes and 11 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 40 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 11 hours and 28 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 15% to 81%, totaling 188 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 12 hours and 16 minutes using a home setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/mhero/i/i/charging_1_st.jpg" title="MHERO I" width="2000" height="1333"  >}}

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. A second port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 6 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.
