## Performance

The MHERO I delivers a jaw-dropping maximum power of 800 KW (1088 hp/1073 bhp) and a massive total torque of 1400 Nm (1033 lb-ft). This powerhouse can rocket from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in just 4.2 seconds, showcasing its astonishing acceleration. Additionally, it achieves a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it a true marvel of engineering and performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 142.7 kWh and a net usable capacity of 135.0 kWh, providing a 7.7 kWh buffer (5.4%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 381.68 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 450 km (280 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 30.0 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 100 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 118 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 61 minutes with an average charging speed of 92 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 9% to 82%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 85 kW, with each charging session taking about 69 minutes and 11 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 40 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 11 hours and 28 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 15% to 81%, with a total charging time of 188 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 12 hours and 16 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/mhero/i/i/charging_1_st.jpg" title="MHERO I" width="2000" height="1333"  >}}

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. A second port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging.

### Bidirectional Charging

This model supports V2L (Vehicle to Load), allowing you to power electrical equipment requiring up to 6 kW of power, including the ability to charge other vehicles.

{{<evkxdisplayaddarticle />}}

## Drivetrain

The MHERO I has an all-wheel drive system supported by four motors. One for each wheel. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front and rear suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 230 mm, and the maximum is 335 mm.

The Easy Entry function lowers the car's body automatically when a door is opened, facilitating easier entry and exit. Once the door closes, the body returns to its previous level.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the MHERO I, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as a standard feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Drive Modes

The MHERO I lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 7 modes:

- Sport: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Normal: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Comfort: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Rock-mode: Balanced steering, high suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Snow mode: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Mud mode: Balanced steering, max suspension height with balanced throttle and damping.
- Individual: User-defined settings for steering, suspension, and throttle response.

### Brakes

The  is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 343 mm, while the rear discs are 343 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

If you lift away the foot completely the regen is at one fixed level. This can't be adjusted.

The maximum regenerative power is 100 kW.

## Exterior

The MHERO I, with dimensions of 4987 mm in length, 2080 mm in width, and 1935 mm in height, falls into the Mid-size SUVs offer a blend of space, comfort, performance, and versatility, making them suitable for a wide range of drivers with diverse needs. The MHERO I is available in a total of 3 paint colors, including several striking matte options.

The MHERO I offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 275/65 tires on 20" rims front and 275/65 tires on 20" rims rear
- 295/60 tires on 20" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [tailgate](../../../../technology/doors/#split-tailgate) where the gate falls down.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass has two panels. One over the first and the second rows, and occupants can both. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. Both glass panels have a manual curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
