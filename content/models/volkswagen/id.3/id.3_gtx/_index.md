## Performance

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 210 kW (286 hp / 282 bhp) and a total torque of 545 Nm (402 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 79.0 kWh, providing a 3.0 kWh buffer (3.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 352 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 600 km (373 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.2 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 185 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 52 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 27 minutes with an average charging speed of 122 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 2% to 54%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 122 kW, with each charging session taking about 20 minutes and 10 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 26 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 1% to 57%, with a total charging time of 66 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 10 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).

### Suspension

The standard suspension has steel springs with a fixed height but an optional damping adjustment. The ground clearance with this suspension is 149 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is an optional on the Volkswagen ID.3 GTX, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

## Exterior

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX, with dimensions of 4264 mm in length, 1809 mm in width, and 1564 mm in height, falls into the C-segment cars, also known as compact cars, strike a balance between size, performance, and affordability, making them versatile for a variety of drivers. The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options. Some of these paint options include two-tone paints where the roof and upper part of the body are painted in a different color, providing a distinctive and stylish look.

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 215/45 tires on 20" rims
- 235/40 tires on 20" rims

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). You can choose an option to have the liftgate electrically powered. You can also have the liftgate with a kick sensor, making it possible to open it by just kicking the foot under the tailgate.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
