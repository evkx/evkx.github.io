## Performance

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX Performance delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 240 kW (326 hp / 322 bhp) and a total torque of 545 Nm (402 lb-ft). It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, range, and charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82 kWh and a net usable capacity of 79 kWh, providing an 3 kWh buffer (3.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 352 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 601 km (374 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 13.1 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 185 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 51 minutes, while a more typical charging scenario from 10% to 80% takes 27 minutes with an average charging speed at 124 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 54%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 124 kW, with each charging session taking about 20 minutes and 34 seconds..

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 25 minutes. This journey would require three charging stops from 2% to 58%, with a total charging time of 66 minutes.

### Onboard charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 10 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

Volkswagen ID.3 GTX Performance has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [MacPherson Strut](../../../../technology/suspension/#macpherson-strut), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). The standard suspension includes steel springs and hydraulic dampers. The Sport Suspension with DCC suspension has steel springs with a fixed height, but you can adjust damping to fit your driving style or road condition. The ground clearance with this suspension is 150 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is an optional feature on the Volkswagen ID.3 GTX Performance. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed.

### Brakes

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX Performance uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358mm.

### Regenerative braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

## Exterior

The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX Performance, with dimensions of 4264 mm in length, 1809 mm in width, and 1564 mm in height, falls into the C-segment cars, also known as compact cars, strike a balance between size, performance, and affordability, making them versatile for a variety of drivers. The Volkswagen ID.3 GTX Performance is available in a total of 5 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel options in different sizes on the Volkswagen ID.3 GTX Performance, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 215/45 tires on 20" rims
- 235/40 tires on 20" rims

More narrow wheels will improve consumption and give a longer range, while wider wheels will provide better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate).

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a large panoramic roof extending over most of the areas from the front to the rear. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
