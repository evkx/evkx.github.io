## Performance

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX LWB delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 250 kW (340 hp / 335 bhp) and a total torque of 560 Nm (413 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 6.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 91.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 86.0 kWh, providing a 5.0 kWh buffer (5.5%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 450 km (280 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 19.1 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 200 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 56 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 33 minutes with an average charging speed of 111 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 42%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 113 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 6 seconds.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 10 hours and 4 minutes. This journey would require six charging stops from 0% to 38%, with a total charging time of 104 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The  onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 49 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX LWB features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/) at the front axle and [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/) at the rear axle.

### Suspension

### Steering

Dynamic steering is an optional on the Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX LWB, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX LWB uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

## Exterior

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX LWB is available in a total of 12 paint colors, including solid, metallic, and pearlescent options.

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz GTX LWB offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims front and 255/50 tires on 19" rims rear
- 235/50 tires on 20" rims front and 265/45 tires on 20" rims rear
- 235/45 tires on 21" rims front and 255/40 tires on 21" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in the first row, [sliding doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in the second row and a tailgate. Powered doors are a standard function for the side doors. You can choose an option to have the liftgate electrically powered. You can also have the liftgate with a kick sensor, making it possible to open it by just kicking the foot under the tailgate.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard is just a regular roof.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
