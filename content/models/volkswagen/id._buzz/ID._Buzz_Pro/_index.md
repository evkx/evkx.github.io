## Performance

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro offers modest performance with a maximum power of 150 kW (204 hp / 201 bhp) and a total torque of 310 Nm (229 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 10.2 seconds and has a top speed of 145 km/h (90 mph), aligning more closely with traditional internal combustion engine vehicles.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 82.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 77.0 kWh, providing a 5.0 kWh buffer (6.1%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 350 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 418 to 410 km (260-255 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 18.4 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 135 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 51 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 30 minutes with an average charging speed of 109 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 0% to 44%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 108 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 44 seconds.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 28 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 10 hours and 12 minutes, requiring six charging stops from 0% to 44%, totaling 112 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 0 minutes using a home setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/volkswagen/id._buzz/id._buzz_pro/charging_1_st.jpg" title="Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro" width="3000" height="2000"  >}}

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Induction Motors](../../../../technology/motors/asm/).

### Suspension

### Steering

Dynamic steering is an optional on the Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort.

### Brakes

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro uses [disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) in the front for superior stopping power and heat dissipation, while [drum brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#drum-brakes) are employed in the rear for cost efficiency and durability. Drum brakes provide adequate performance for the rear wheels, require less maintenance, and integrate seamlessly with the vehicle's regenerative braking system. This combination ensures optimal braking performance and cost-effectiveness, aligning with the overall efficiency goals of the EV. The front discs are 358 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

## Exterior

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro is available in a total of 12 paint colors, including solid, metallic, and pearlescent options.

The Volkswagen ID. Buzz Pro offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 19" rims front and 255/50 tires on 19" rims rear
- 235/50 tires on 20" rims front and 265/45 tires on 20" rims rear
- 235/45 tires on 21" rims front and 255/40 tires on 21" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has two [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in the first row, [sliding doors](../../../../technology/doors/) in the second row and a tailgate. Powered doors are a standard function for the side doors. You can choose an option to have the liftgate electrically powered. You can also have the liftgate with a kick sensor, making it possible to open it by just kicking the foot under the tailgate.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard is just a regular roof.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
