## Performance

The VinFast VF8 Plus delivers a solid performance with a maximum power of 300 kW (408 hp / 402 bhp) and a total torque of 620 Nm (458 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 200 km/h (124 mph), making it competitive within its class.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 94.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 87.7 kWh, providing a 6.3 kWh buffer (6.7%) for battery protection. With a nominal voltage of 403 volts, the system is classified as a 400-volt battery system, aligning with industry standards.

According to the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range is 447 km (278 miles), with an energy consumption rate of 19.6 kWh/100 km (3 mi/kWh). For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 110 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 107 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 45 minutes with an average charging speed of 83 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 11% to 70%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 76 kW, with each charging session taking about 41 minutes and 49 seconds.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 7 hours and 58 minutes using a home charging setup.

### Charge Port

The location of the charge port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to charge stations where you park side into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

### Brakes

The VinFast VF8 Plus is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 375 mm, while the rear discs are 341 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) in this model is primarily facilitated through [**one-pedal driving**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving). Unlike some models, [Automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive) or coasting is not available here. You can choose between two stopping modes for one-pedal driving. <ul><li>**Roll mode** allows the vehicle to roll until it stops naturally</li><li>**Creep mode** moves the car forward at low speed</li></ul>

Additionally, you can adjust the strength of the regenerative braking when you lift your foot off the accelerator. There are two levels of regenerative braking to choose from, allowing you to customize the driving experience to your preference.

## Exterior

The VinFast VF8 Plus, with dimensions of 4750 mm in length, 1934 mm in width, and 1667 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The VinFast VF8 Plus is available in a total of 8 paint colors, including several striking metallic options.

You can select from multiple wheel designs, all available in the same size, on the VinFast VF8 Plus, allowing you to personalize your vehicle to match your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The liftgate is electric-powered and has a kick-sensor as standard.

There is only one roof option for this model. The standard roof has a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

The windows from the B-pillar and back are tinted, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
