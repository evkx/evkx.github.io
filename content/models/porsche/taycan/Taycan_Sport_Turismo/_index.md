## Battery, Range, and Charging

The Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo is available with two battery options, each offering different specifications and performance metrics.

### Performance Battery Plus

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 105.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97.0 kWh, providing a 8.0 kWh buffer (7.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 725 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 678 to 579 km (421-360 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.3 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 320 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 47 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed of 260 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 209 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 48 seconds. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 8 hours and 53 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 5% to 64%, totaling 33 minutes of charging time.

### Performance Battery

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 89.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 83.6 kWh, providing a 5.4 kWh buffer (6.1%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 725 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 590 to 503 km (367-313 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 14.3 kWh/100 km for the base model and 16.8 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 51 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 18 minutes with an average charging speed of 191 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 64%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 162 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 51 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 8 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 4% to 55%, totaling 48 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 8 hours and 49 minutes using a home setup. An optional 22 kW onboard charger reduces the full charge time to approximately 4 hours and 24 minutes.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. Additionally, a second port on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side) offers greater flexibility for AC charging. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

You can order Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 103 mm, and the maximum is 127 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs measure 360 mm, while the rear discs are 358 mm. The second option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs measure 410 mm, while the rear discs are 365 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

The maximum regenerative power is 265 kW.

## Exterior

The Porsche Taycan Sport Turismo, with dimensions of 4963 mm in length, 1964 mm in width, and 1395 mm in height, falls into E-segment cars, also known as executive cars, are larger and more luxurious than their D-segment counterparts.
