## Performance



With the optional Performance Battery Plus battery, you get other performance numbers. With overboost, the Porsche Taycan GTS has a maximum power of 440KW (598hp). Without overboost, it is 320KW (435hp). The torque is 850nm with overboost and  without overboost. It performs the 0-100km/h sprint (0-62mph) in 3,7 seconds. The top speed is 250 km/h. 

## Battery, range, and charging

The battery has a gross capacity of 93,4kWh and a net capacity of 83,7kWh, meaning you have a 9,7kWh buffer for protection. (10,4%). The Lithium-Ion battery uses [NMC technology.](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc) 

The [WLTP range](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp) varies from 504 to 439 km (313-273 mi), depending on car options. Bigger wheels are an example of an equipment option that increases consumption and reduces the electric range.   The consumption is between 16,6kWh/100km for the basic version and 19,1kWh/100km for the top trim version for the WLTP standard test. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listing on this model's [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page. 

The maximum DC charging speed is 270kW. A full charge from 0 - 100% would take 50 minutes, while a more common scenario of 10-80% would take 18 minutes. If you assume you lose 5 minutes driving per charge stop in addition to the charge time, the optimum charge area is from 3% to 65%, resulting in an actual charge speed, including time loss on 165kW. Each charge session would take 19 minutes and 53 seconds. 

For the theoretical 1000km challenge, starting with a full battery and driving at 120km/h (75 mph), assuming optimal driving conditions and consumption of 22kWh/100km, 1000km will take 9 hours and 10 minutes to drive. This trip will require three charge session(s) charging from 3% to 58%. The total time lost for charging up the battery will be 51 minutes.

### Onboard charger

For level 1 and level 2 AC charging, the standard onboard charger supports up to 11KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 7 hours and 36 minutes. You can also select an optional onboard charger that supports up to 22KW charging. As a result, you can charge the battery 0-100% from home in about 3 hours and 48 minutes. 

### Charge port

The location of the charge port is on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This location makes it easy to use charge stations where you park side into the charger.  The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) for North America and for Europe, [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs). See full specifications for all markets. A second port is on the [left front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side). This extra port gives you more parking options for AC charging. The connector types vary between the different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and for Europe, [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2). See full specifications for all markets.

## Drivetrain

Porsche Taycan GTS has an all-wheel drive system supported by two motors, one on each axle. The motor(s) used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/). 



You can order Porsche Taycan GTS with an alternative Adaptive Air Suspension suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 103 mm, and the max is 127 mm. 

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard feature on the Porsche Taycan GTS. Dynamic steering varies the steering ratio as a function of driving speed. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.  

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes).

It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs are 410mm, and the rear discs are 365mm. 

[Regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) is available in several modes. The most efficient is [automatic regen](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive). In this mode, the car coasts when possible and uses regenerative braking to reduce speed. You can also enable [one-pedal driving](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving).
