## Battery, Range, and Charging

The Porsche Taycan is available with two battery options, each offering different specifications and performance metrics.

### Performance Battery

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 89.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 82.3 kWh, providing a 6.7 kWh buffer (7.5%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 618 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 678 to 579 km (421-360 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 12.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.2 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 51 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 18 minutes with an average charging speed of 191 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 3% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 162 kW, with each charging session taking about 19 minutes and 57 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Porsche Taycan a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 9 hours and 8 minutes, requiring three charging stops from 4% to 56%, totaling 48 minutes of charging time.

### Performance Battery Plus

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 105.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 97.0 kWh, providing a 8.0 kWh buffer (7.6%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 729 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 590 to 503 km (367-313 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 12.1 kWh/100 km for the base model and 14.2 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 320 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 47 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 16 minutes with an average charging speed of 260 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 65%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 209 kW, with each charging session taking about 18 minutes and 48 seconds. This exceptionally fast charging capability makes the Porsche Taycan one of the most efficient and convenient EVs for long-distance travel.

In a 1000 km challenge at a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) with an assumed consumption rate of 21 kWh/100 km, the trip would take about 8 hours and 53 minutes, requiring two charging stops from 5% to 64%, totaling 33 minutes of charging time.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging, allowing a full charge from 0 to 100% in about 7 hours and 28 minutes using a home setup. An optional 22 kW onboard charger reduces the full charge time to approximately 3 hours and 44 minutes.

### Charge Port

The charge port is conveniently located on the [right front side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side), facilitating easy access at charging stations where you park parallel to the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe.

## Drivetrain

The Porsche Taycan has a rear-wheel drive system supported by one motor on the rear axle. The motor used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 103 mm, and the maximum is 126 mm.

You can order Porsche Taycan with an alternative Porsche Active Ride suspension. The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 103 mm, and the maximum is 128 mm.

The Active Suspension maintains the car's body nearly horizontal during dynamic braking, steering, and acceleration, enhancing precise steering response and driver control..

Normally, cars lean outward in corners. However, the active cornering dynamics can counteract this roll, or even overcompensate, making the car lean into bends like a motorcycle.

The Easy Entry function raises the car's body automatically when a door is opened, facilitating easier entry and exit. Once the door closes, the body returns to its previous level.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Porsche Taycan, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Drive Modes

The Porsche Taycan lets the user select different [drive modes](../../../../technology/drivemodes/) that affect the car's handling. The driver can choose between 5 modes:

- Range: Balanced steering, low suspension with efficient throttle, and balanced suspension.
- Normal: Balanced steering, normal suspension height with efficient throttle, and comfort suspension damping.
- Sport: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Sport Plus: Dynamic steering, low suspension with dynamic throttle and suspension.
- Individual: User-defined settings for steering, suspension, and throttle response.

### Brakes

You can choose between different brake systems. The standard option brakes use regular [cast-iron discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes). The front discs measure 360 mm, while the rear discs are 358 mm. The standard option brakes use a [cast-iron disc coated with tungsten carbide](../../../../technology/brakes/#carbid-brakes). It doesn't rust and produces hardly any brake dust. The front discs measure 410 mm, while the rear discs are 365 mm. The standard option brakes uses [ceramic discs](../../../../technology/brakes/#ceramic-brakes). The front discs measure 420 mm, while the rear discs are 410 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**. However, it is not considered full one-pedal driving since, at low speeds, the vehicle will keep rolling until it comes to a stop by itself.

If you lift away the foot completely the regen is at one fixed level. This can't be adjusted.

The maximum regenerative power is 265 kW.
