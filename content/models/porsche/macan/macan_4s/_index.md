## Performance

With overboost, the Porsche Macan 4S reaches a maximum power of 380 kW (517 hp / 510 bhp). Without overboost, it delivers 330 kW (449 hp / 443 bhp). The maximum torque is 820 Nm (605 lb-ft). It accelerates from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.1 seconds and reaches a top speed of 240 km/h (149 mph), demonstrating its solid performance.

## Battery, Range, and Charging

The high-capacity battery has a gross capacity of 100.0 kWh and a net usable capacity of 94.9 kWh, providing a 5.1 kWh buffer (5.1%) for battery protection. Operating at a nominal voltage of 662 volts, it qualifies as an 800-volt battery system. This high voltage is pivotal in enabling the system's charging capabilities. This Lithium-Ion battery utilizes [NMC (Nickel Manganese Cobalt) technology](../../../../technology/battery/cellchemistry/#lithium-nickel-manganese-cobalt-oxides-nmc).

Under the [WLTP](../../../../guides/understandingrange/wltp/) (Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure) standard, the vehicle's range varies between 609 to 512 km (379-318 miles), depending on the specific configuration and options, such as wheel size. Larger wheels can increase energy consumption and subsequently reduce the overall range. The vehicle's energy consumption is rated at 15.6 kWh/100 km for the base model and 18.5 kWh/100 km for the top-tier model under the WLTP test cycle. For more details about the range, see real-world data and range listings on this model’s [range and consumption](rangeandconsumption/) page.

The vehicle supports fast DC charging with a maximum power of 270 kW. Charging from 0% to 100% takes approximately 60 minutes, while a more typical scenario from 10% to 80% takes 21 minutes with an average charging speed of 192 kW. Considering an additional 5 minutes for each charging stop due to driving interruptions, the optimal charging range is from 1% to 62%. This results in an effective charging speed, including time lost, of 169 kW, with each charging session taking about 21 minutes and 36 seconds. This efficient charging capability makes the Porsche Macan 4S a convenient option for long-distance travel.

In a theoretical 1000 km challenge, starting with a full battery and maintaining a constant speed of 120 km/h (75 mph) under ideal conditions with an assumed consumption rate of 22 kWh/100 km, the trip would take approximately 9 hours and 4 minutes. This journey would require two charging stops from 1% to 67%, with a total charging time of 45 minutes.

### Onboard Charger

The standard onboard charger supports up to 11 kW for Level 1 and Level 2 AC charging. This allows you to fully charge the battery from 0 to 100% in approximately 8 hours and 37 minutes using a home charging setup.

{{< sitefiguresized thumb="models/porsche/macan/macan_4s/charging_1_st.jpeg" title="Porsche Macan 4S" width="3000" height="1687"  >}}

### Charge Port

The charge port is located on the [left rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#rear-side), making it easy to use charge stations where you need to back up into the charger. Connector types vary by market: this model uses [**CCS Combo 1**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in North America and [**CCS Combo 2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#ccs) in Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications. Additionally, a second port on the [right rear side](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#front-side) offers greater flexibility for AC charging. The connector types vary between different markets. This model uses [**J1772**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#j1772) for North America and [**TYPE2**](../../../../technology/charging/connectors/#type-2) for Europe. For complete specifications for all markets, refer to the full specifications.

## Drivetrain

The Porsche Macan 4S features an all-wheel drive system powered by two motors, one on each axle. The motors used are [Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors](../../../../technology/motors/pmsm/).

### Suspension

The front suspension is [double wishbone](../../../../technology/suspension/#double-wishbone), and the rear suspension is [Multilink](../../../../technology/suspension/#multilink). It uses air suspension and hydraulic dampers. The suspension is fully adaptive on the front and rear axle, so height and damping can be adjusted manually and automatically. The minimum ground clearance is 184 mm, and the maximum is 224 mm.

### Steering

Dynamic steering is a standard on the Porsche Macan 4S, varying the steering ratio based on driving speed for enhanced control and comfort. In addition,  rear-wheel steering is available as an optional feature. Rear wheel steering reduces the turning circle when going slow.

### Brakes

The Porsche Macan 4S is equipped with [cast-iron disc brakes](../../../../technology/brakes/#disc-brakes) on both the front and rear. The front discs measure 410 mm, while the rear discs are 365 mm.

### Regenerative Braking

The [regenerative braking](../../../../technology/regen/) system in this model offers several modes to enhance efficiency and driving experience. The most efficient option is the [**Automatic Regeneration Mode**](../../../../technology/regen/#automatic-regen-adaptive), where the vehicle coasts when possible and employs regenerative braking to reduce speed as needed. <br /><br />**Manual regeneration** is another mode, where regenerative braking is controlled by pressing the brake pedal. The brake system blends in physical brakes only when necessary. <br /><br/>  Another option is the [**Regen on Accelerator Pedal**](../../../../technology/regen/#one-pedal-driving) mode where regenerative braking is activated when the driver eases off the accelerator pedal.  This system allows the vehicle to slow down and recover energy without the driver needing to press the brake pedal, a feature often referred to as **one-pedal driving**.

The maximum regenerative power is 275 kW.

## Exterior

The Porsche Macan 4S, with dimensions of 4784 mm in length, 1938 mm in width, and 1622 mm in height, falls into the Compact SUVs category, also known as C-SUVs. These offer a balance between the practicality and maneuverability of smaller vehicles and the space and versatility of larger SUVs. The Porsche Macan 4S is available in a total of 13 paint colors, including both solid and metallic options.

You can also choose from several styling options to make your car more unique.
The optional SportDesign package contains a specially designed upper part front apron, specially designed side skirts in Black with inlays painted in exterior color specially designed rear diffusor in Black with side fins painted in exterior color, front licence plate carrier painted in exterior color. 


 The optional SportDesign package Carbon contains a specially designed upper part front apron, lower part front apron with inlays in carbon, specially designed side skirts in Black with inlays in carbon, specially designed rear diffusor in Black with side fins in carbon, front licence plate carrier painted in exterior color. 


The optional SportDesign package HighGloss black contains a specially designed upper part front apron, specially designed side skirts in Black with inlays painted in Black (high-gloss), specially designed rear diffusor in Black with side fins painted in Black (high-gloss),front licence plate carrier painted in exterior color. 

The Porsche Macan 4S offers multiple wheel options in different sizes, allowing you to customize your vehicle to suit your style and driving preferences. The available tire and wheel combinations include:

- 235/55 tires on 20" rims front and 285/45 tires on 20" rims rear
- 245/45 tires on 21" rims front and 295/40 tires on 21" rims rear
- 255/40 tires on 22" rims front and 295/35 tires on 22" rims rear
- 265/35 tires on 22" rims front and 305/30 tires on 22" rims rear

Narrower wheels improve consumption and provide a longer range, while wider wheels offer better traction and handling.

The car has four [regular doors](../../../../technology/doors/) and a [liftgate](../../../../technology/doors/#liftgate). The electric-powered liftgate has a kick-sensor as optional equipment, making it possible to open it by just kicking the foot under the tailgate.

There are two different roof options to select from. The standard is just a regular roof. As an option, you can order this model with a panoramic roof. The glass extends most of the roof, and occupants can open the front part. This glass makes the car’s interior feel more spacious and bright, which can improve the mood and comfort of the occupant. It has an electric curtain that occupants can use to protect against the sun.

Additionally, you can order the car with tinted windows from the B-pillar backward, which enhances privacy and reduces glare and heat from the sun, making the interior more comfortable for passengers.
