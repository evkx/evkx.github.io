## How to Verify Battery Health

Battery health is a crucial factor that affects the performance and value of an electric vehicle (EV). It measures how much capacity and power the battery can deliver compared to when it was new. A healthy battery provides a longer range, faster charging, and lower degradation. Conversely, a degraded battery reduces range, increases charging time, and lowers the resale value of the EV.

However, calculating battery health is not as simple as looking at the percentage of charge or the number of miles driven. Battery health depends on many variables, such as age, usage, temperature, and battery chemistry. Therefore, it's useful to know how to estimate battery health using mathematical indicators and formulas.

This guide will show you how to calculate the battery health of your EV using math. We will explain the main indicators of battery health, such as State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), Depth of Discharge (DOD), and cycle life. Additionally, we will provide formulas and examples to help you estimate the battery health of your EV.

## Understanding Range

One of the most important and frequently asked questions about electric vehicles (EVs) is how far they can go on a single charge. The range of an EV is the distance it can travel before the battery needs to be recharged. This range depends on many factors, including battery size, driving speed, weather conditions, and driving style. Therefore, providing a precise and universal answer to this question is challenging.

However, there are ways to estimate and compare the range of different EVs using standardized tests and ratings, such as WLTP and EPA. These tests are designed to measure the range of EVs under controlled and realistic conditions, providing consumers with reliable and comparable information. Nevertheless, these tests may not always reflect the actual range you can achieve in your daily driving.

In this article, we will cover everything you need to know about the range of EVs. We will explain what affects the rated and real-world range of EVs, how to use the WLTP and EPA standards to measure and compare EV ranges, and how to improve and optimize your EV range. By reading this article, you will gain a better understanding of EV range and how to choose and use an EV that meets your needs.
